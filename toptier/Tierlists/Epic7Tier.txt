Her kit is pretty much overloaded, but the real stars of the show are her passive and S3.</p>\n<p>Her passive makes her completely immune to being Stunned, for one thing. On top of that, she completely punishes anyone using AoE attacks by increasing her Combat Readiness by 8% for every ally except the caster attacked; when she&#8217;s hit with an attack that hits all allies, she&#8217;ll activate a part of her passive called Guardian Angel (though, you gotta fully skill up her passive for the 100% activation chance) that dispels a debuff from all allies and grants them skill nullifier once. The downside of this is that Guardian Angel only activates once every 3 turns, so there&#8217;s a couple turns of downtime for it.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have her s3, which dispels two buffs from all enemies, before silencing them and making them unbuffable for 2 turns. (Again, 100% chance when skilled up.) Her s3 deals no damage, meaning that it can&#8217;t land as a Miss &#8211; all it has to worry about is the Effectiveness/Resistance check, similarly to Flan&#8217;s s3. On top of that, due to dealing 0 damage, she can&#8217;t trigger any other units that punish AoE units (such as Inferno Khawazu or Rem).</p>\n<p><strong>She&#8217;s used solely for PvP use</strong>, but she <em>really</em> shines there, as you can see. Angel of Light Angelica can completely shut down the enemy units and leave them unable to use anything except their basic skills, along with punishing them should they resist her Silence and pop off with an AoE attack.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>You want her to be fast and with high Effectiveness. Her Speed and EFF% are her two most important substats to focus on, although you don&#8217;t want to neglect her bulk. She&#8217;s meant to be a fast, tanky opener, meaning it&#8217;d do you good to put her on a <strong>Speed</strong> set. Depending on your gear quality, her second set should be either <strong>Hit </strong>or <strong>Immunity.</strong> Although Immunity can be a bit of a safety net, using Hit as a second-set can ease up on the Effectiveness% you need to get from her gear.</p>\n<p>A very good, late-game Angel of Light Angelica build looks to be about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15,000+ HP</li>\n<li>1,600 Defense</li>\n<li>270+ Speed <em>at the least</em></li>\n<li>180% Effectiveness <em>at the least</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this build requires high gear quality, and is for late-game players.

She can reduce enemy combat readiness with her ult and do good damage. Also in certain Abyss floors, you will need to bring no debuff DPS (Specter Tenebria in Floor 90 is the first that comes to mind), which she can fill that role.

She&#8217;s an absolute monster in PVE content, and you can use her almost everywhere except Wyvern.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s best to note that she&#8217;s not the best in PVP, as it&#8217;ll take her 5 turns to build up to her full potential.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>C.Lorina is pretty versatile and easy to build, as you can use the free Attack Set that the Adventurer&#8217;s Path gives you.

However, it&#8217;s best to aim your final Commander Lorina stat goals to be something along the lines of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3k-4k ATK</li>\n<li>90%+ Crit Chance (100% is optimal)</li>\n<li>250-300% Crit Damage</li>\n<li>160+ Speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Build Note: </strong>If you can achieve 160 speed with just substats, then you can leave her on ATK% boots, as stated in her Recommended Sets.

You do want to have <em>some</em> speed on C.Lorina, even if you have Hell Cutter on her, so she can actually get a turn.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to stack <em>some</em> HP on Commander Lorina, so she doesn&#8217;t immediately die if the enemies even breathe on her funny.

While C.Lilias is not, say, a unit that can singlehandedly solo everyone in the enemy team, the amount of buffs and debuffs that she provides is more than enough to enable her own team to unlock their full potential.</p>\n<p>As her s3 provides AoE Vigor to everyone on her team (the undispellable debuff that increases the wearer&#8217;s Attack and Defense by 30%), decreases enemy buff durations, <em>and</em> decreases their attack for 2 turns before granting her a second turn, Conqueror Lilias can make for a great opening unit. On top of this, with her extra turn on her s3, she can chain that into her S2, which decreases a chosen enemy&#8217;s Combat Readiness by 25%, before inflicting Redirected Provoke for a turn, before granting herself and the tankiest ally in her team a barrier for 2 turns. Her S1 isn&#8217;t anything to write home about, as it&#8217;s pretty much the exact same as her RGB variant. She will attack an enemy with her sword, before pulling along a random ally with her for a Dual Attack.</p>\n<p>C.Lilias is not exactly a PvE unit &#8211; players wouldn&#8217;t want to put her in a Wyvern 13 team and expect success, for example. However, where she shines is in anything PvP related. She makes for a great opener in Guild War Offense, Arena Offense, and &#8211; of course &#8211; RTA. In fact, she has a very high first-pick rate in RTA, and it&#8217;s rare that she can make it past the banning stage.

This is not because she requires a weird myriad of stats, but because a player will want to stack her Speed and other stats as high as possible, to the point that the goalpost for the &#8220;ideal Conqueror Lilias build&#8221; is so high it&#8217;s pretty much unattainable for newer players.</p>\n<p>She <em>needs</em> to have <strong>Speed</strong> as her four-set gear.

Upon taking a counter attack, she gains combat readiness and her S2 passive gains 1000 fixed damage, up to 4 times.</p>\n<p>This allows her to gradually take them down with the increased fixed damage and heal herself as well. She herself is pretty tanky and her S3 provides 3 turn defense buff for the whole team. Most of the time, you will be waiting for the counter attacks to stack your passive and finish them in longer fights.</p>\n<p>She will excel against bruiser counter teams with little to no sustain. However, if there isn&#8217;t any unit that is particularly counterattack heavy, then Hasol is limited to maybe 500 damage. She isn&#8217;t a unit that you can take into any team and instantly win; you would have to plot to take her against a specific type of team.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Build Notes</strong></p>\n<p><em>DON&#8217;T </em>put Hasol on counterattack; it would be utterly wasted on her. Even though she <em>can</em> heal herself on her s1 in counterattacking, her fixed damage only applies on her turn.

She can&#8217;t really do that properly either whenever he&#8217;s paired with Politis, due to how she decreases the amount of Combat Readiness gain that the enemies get to receive. Although she has no non-attack skills in her kit (thankfully making her unable to trigger the other half of Politis&#8217;s s2), a large part of her kit is pushing her allies&#8217; Combat Readiness, and Politis greatly limits that.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say she&#8217;s a bad unit, though &#8211; she is pretty good, and her kit is nice, but she&#8217;s just not in the meta anymore.

Her skill 2 passive is what makes her good against Basar. Since it increases evasion by 35% (and an additional 35% too), Basar is all but guaranteed to miss, allowing her to cleanse debuffs and counter push your own allies. The passive also reduces combat readiness pushback as well.</p>\n<p>Her skill 1 is an AoE burn attack which ignores elemental disadvantage (but it is a single target when she dual attacks). Just like with Dizzy&#8217;s lack of single-target, this AoE attack is a double-edged sword; especially so in the meta of Rem + Violet.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>When building H.Yufine, the best build for her will be the <strong>General Speed Build</strong>, of Speed + Immunity.

However, do note that these are pretty end-game stats, and it won&#8217;t be very easy to achieve them immediately.</p>\n<p>Having the limited artifact Junkyard Dog from Guilty Gear collab makes her skill 1 so much better.

He&#8217;s one of the two units who can plant Vigor on himself, in exchange for good things happening. When he has vigor, his 75% burn chance on his s1 becomes 100% and plants two Burns on the enemy, and his burns on his S3 ignores Effect Resistance on Vigor. After that, his S3 <em>detonates all burns in the enemy</em>. On top of that, his passive pretty much punishes any unit who uses an AoE skill &#8211; if he&#8217;s hit with an attack that targets all allies he removes all debuffs on himself, heals based on his Attack power, and increases his Combat Readiness by 20% before putting Vigor on himself. Granted, it&#8217;s only usable once every 2 turns, but considering how he has 2-turn Vigor, it&#8217;s pretty much just constant Vigor cycling if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s been tested in Arena a lot these past few weeks, and it&#8217;s been proven that he can actually pop Tempest Surin from under Fallen Cecilia, without proc&#8217;ing her insanely annoying passive. Fallen Cecilia will put skill nullifier on Tempest Surin, which will then activate Inferno Khawazu&#8217;s passive, and sets him up for his s3 &#8211; the skill nullifier negates any damage on his s3 that might trigger Surin&#8217;s passive ahead of time, but his dispel will destroy any barrier or immunity she has, place the burns, and <em>then</em> detonate. This detonation should be able to burst down T.Surin if you&#8217;ve built Khawazu with enough ATK.</p>\n<p>The only two teams that he really can&#8217;t shine his best in are teams with no AoE attacks and Champion Zerato teams. (As it turns out, C.Zerato transfers debuffs back before the detonation can occur.) However, when he&#8217;s drafted against the right team, he can very much carry the battle with a lucky AoE hit! He pairs up great with Researcher Carrot, too.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>There are two ways you can build Inferno Khawazu: the regular <strong>Fast Burns </strong>build, or the <strong>Counter Build</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot harder to build him with counterattack, since Counter gear doesn&#8217;t offer any gains to stats and he&#8217;s already slow as-is. The Counter Build is mostly to be considered as a fun joke idea to play around with, but if you&#8217;re going for a serious &#8220;works every time&#8221; build, then Fast Burns is the way to go.</p>\n<p>Inferno Khawazu is one of the few damage-dealing units where you don&#8217;t want to put any Crit Damage or Crit Rate on him, because Burns deal more damage based off of the caster&#8217;s Attack. On top of that, his multipliers on the actual skills aren&#8217;t that very good; even if you build him Destruction/Crit with the best Crit Damage/Rate stats possible, you won&#8217;t be doing any real nuking with him. The best stats to aim for are <strong>Attack </strong>and <strong>Speed</strong>, with <strong>HP% </strong>and <strong>Def%</strong> also being pretty necessary. Effectiveness% isn&#8217;t a must-have stat on him, considering how his s3 ignores Resistance; however, some recommend putting some on him just in case (also for his S1).</p>\n<p>A good Inferno Khawazu build looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4,000+ ATK (at the bare minimum)</li>\n<li>200+ Speed</li>\n<li>18,000 HP</li>\n<li>1,500 Defense</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Should you find yourself lacking in Effectiveness, it&#8217;s alright to switch out the Immunity in Fast Burns for Hit until you can get good Immunity gear on him. However, Immunity on the Counter Build is necessary for him (and for pretty much anyone built Counter).</p>\n<p><strong>Note 2: </strong>Inferno Khawazu specifically uses Oath Key and <strong>not</strong> A Symbol of Unity when putting an artifact on him to counter Tempest Surin. You <strong>don&#8217;t want the extra damage that Unity gives</strong>, because T.Surin&#8217;s passive cleanses her of all debuffs and increases her Combat Readiness if someone ends a turn with her below 70% HP. Khawazu&#8217;s Burn detonation goes through her passive&#8217;s &#8220;can&#8217;t take more than 51% damage in one turn&#8221; effect, and her &#8220;Cleans debuffs if below 70% HP&#8221;.</p>\n","rarity":"4","rating":{"world":"6","abyss":"7","boss":"7","raid":"7","arena":"8.5","guild_wars":"9"},"class":"Warrior","element":"Dark","link":"https://epic7x.com/character/inferno-khawazu/"},{"name":"Infinite Horizon Achates","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infinite-horizon-achates-icon.png","tierlist_artifacts":[{"title":"Guardian Ice Crystals","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/guardian-ice-crystals/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Guardian-Ice-Crystals.png","custom_title":"Extra Healing","description":"Some effect resistance and some healing for allies under 50% HP."}],"sets":[{"title":"Resistant","set_1":"Speed","set_2":"Resist","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Hp%","ring":"Def%","boots":"Speed"}],"description":"<p>Infinite Horizon Achates is a versatile healer that can cleanse, provide combat readiness for herself and allies.

Her passive provides a 25% debuff chance for the ally in the backline for 2 turns. The cool thing about the passive is that it will still activate on a miss on the enemy, much like abyssal crown. So the best units to use in the backline are units with AoE attacks. Belian, Politis, Seaside Bellona, Summer Iseria, Peira, Ran and so on. Once an enemy is gets a debuff by her passive from her ally, she gets bonus combat readiness. There is some RNG element there, which can be fun&#8230;or not.</p>\n<p>Her S3 is a decent single target attack that provides attack buff and defense penetration. Allies get bonus CR push if she kills an enemy. S3 does require debuffs for bonus damage. The same goes for S1. If enemy has a debuff, she gets an extra attack and stealth mode! Keep in mind that if her S1 kills a debuffed enemy, her S1 proc will hit another enemy instead.</p>\n<p>The problem is that she needs a team that can debuff the enemies to make her shine. If she is built with heavy offense, there is not much left for survivability and effectiveness stat. High effect resist teams and cleansers are a huge threat to her ability to do well. I guess that is the trade off for having a passive that provides team utility.</p>\n<p>She is a lot stronger now though after the changes. The team CR push is a much better fit in heavy debuff speed teams.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Build Notes</strong></p>\n<p>She is stat hungry and will require top gear to perform well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3.5k+ Attack</li>\n<li>100% Crit Rate</li>\n<li>250%+ Crit Damage</li>\n<li>200+ Speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Effectiveness stat is a bonus if you can get some on it. Anything more than 0% is great, but it&#8217;s not really necessary for her. Speed can be sacrificed if you can&#8217;t get 3.5k+ attack with at least 250% crit damage.

He boasts a passive that works like a built-in Wondrous Potion Vial; once fully skilled up, he&#8217;ll remove a debuff inflicted on an ally at the beginning of each turn. His s3 is also semi-useful too, as it grants Continuous Healing to all of his allies for 2 turns. He&#8217;s also one of the few units who has Speed imprint, as well.</p>\n<p>However, there are multiple things that hold him back. His base HP is <em>disgustingly</em> low (even for Soul Weavers), and his DEF isn&#8217;t the best either. He doesn&#8217;t offer any <em>direct</em> healing in his kit either &#8211; any healing he provides comes from his Continuous Healing buff &#8211; and his s2&#8217;s debuff removal is a bit randomized, with no other cleanse in his kit.</p>\n<p>Overall, Jecht can work if you have no one else, but remember that both Montmorancy and Angelica are now available in Hero Connections just like him. Angelica, with her Exclusive Equipment, removes a debuff off of all allies with her s3, and Montmorancy (once changed to Angelic Montmorancy) can easily cycle her s2 and s3 for constant debuff removal.

With 50% crit rate buff, she is much easier to build.</p>\n<p>She will be great in Golem and Azimanak Hunts, Lab and also the Abyss since she has cleanse and is a knight that can hold Aurius, further helping your team to mitigate more damage. With her dual attack, you will want to bring more offensive units to abuse the bonus DPS each time she uses her S1.</p>\n<p>In PvP, she can be either the main cleaver or the secondary cleaver if you have a very high attack (4k+) DPS alongside her. Or she can also just be the primary cleanser and disruptor with her S2 provoke.

His kit was practically made for Wyvern 13, and it shows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Build Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Muwi is surprisingly easy to gear. A newer player can use the <strong>Free ATK Set </strong>build at first &#8211; which is, quite literally, the ATK Set that they get from the Adventurer&#8217;s Path at the beginning of the game. After that, once a player is later on in the game and has gathered up some better gear, they can make the switch to the <strong>High Damage W13 </strong>build.</p>\n<p>The ideal stats for Muwi is going to look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>35% Crit Chance</li>\n<li>65% Effectiveness</li>\n<li>138 Speed</li>\n<li>As much ATK as possible</li>\n<li>As much Crit DMG as possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These stats are extremely easy to get (with maybe the exception of the Effectiveness%, however a player can get a ring with EFF% as the main stat to fix that). 35% Crit Chance is because Furious will constantly provide the extra 50% via his S2, and Ice units get a 15% Crit Chance Bonus against the Wyvern.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Artifacts, there is no better option than <strong>Daydream Joker</strong>. Although there <em>are</em> other artifacts that work fine on Muwi (such as Dust Devil or Torn Sleeve), there&#8217;s no real reason to give him anything other than Daydream Joker, due to the nature of it being such a good artifact to boost his damage.</p>\n","rarity":"3","rating":{"world":"6.5","abyss":"7","boss":"9","raid":"7","arena":"6","guild_wars":"5.5"},"class":"Thief","element":"Ice","link":"https://epic7x.com/character/muwi/"},{"name":"Nahkwol","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nahkwol-icon.png","tierlist_artifacts":[{"title":"Elegiac Candle","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/elegiac-candle/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-27-at-11.14.02-PM.png","custom_title":"Defense Break","description":"Provide extra utility by being able to land defense break."},{"title":"Guiding Light","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/guiding-light/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/guiding-light.png","custom_title":"Stealth","description":"Gains some protection from AoE attacks."}],"sets":[{"title":"DPS Build","set_1":"Speed","set_2":"Crit Rate","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Crit Damage%","ring":"Atk%","boots":"Speed"},{"title":"Speed Debuffer","set_1":"Speed","set_2":"Hit Rate","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Hp%","ring":"Effectiveness","boots":"Speed"}],"description":"<p>Nahkwol is extremely strong thanks to her debuff kit that will cripple the enemy team as long as she lands her debuffs.

Plus, with the part of her passive that makes her AoE counterattack take priority over a basic attack when she counters makes her perfect for &#8211; well, a Counter set.</p>\n<p>People have used Rem in PvE (namely, Wyvern 13) before, due to her semi-reliable buffs and Defense Break on her s1, including the fact that she ignores Effect Resistance on Demon Mode. However, she shines most in PVP, and some would say not to use Rem in Wyvern 13 at all, as there are better choices (e.g. Sigret, Seaside Bellona, Alexa, etc). It&#8217;s still worth noting that she can be used there, though.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>Rem doesn&#8217;t need Immunity nearly as bad as most other Counter units, due to Demon Mode essentially being a 2-turn Immunity built in. The <strong>Counterattacking </strong><strong>Build</strong> is a given, due to her AoE attack taking priority over her s1 for counters. However, the <strong>General Speed Build</strong> is more or less for if you don&#8217;t have the gear quality to achieve a good Rem build with Counter, as most units in the game can always benefit with a Speed set.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s best to replace her Speed set with Counter as soon as you can, though, because the extra chances to activate Iron Strike will be greatly appreciated by you.</p>\n<p>A good Rem build looks to be about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3,500+ ATK</li>\n<li>1,200~ Defense</li>\n<li>15,000-17,000 HP</li>\n<li>100% Crit Rate</li>\n<li>250%-300%+ Crit Damage</li>\n<li>150+ Speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rem is rather stat-hungry, so it might be difficult to get her to the ideal Rem build. If she&#8217;s on a Speed build, you can expect to see about <strong>170</strong><strong> Speed</strong> instead of 150.</p>\n","rarity":"5","rating":{"world":"7","abyss":"7","boss":"8.5","raid":"7","arena":"9.5","guild_wars":"9.5"},"class":"Warrior","element":"Ice","link":"https://epic7x.com/character/rem/"},{"name":"Remnant Violet","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remnant-violet-icon.jpg","tierlist_artifacts":[{"title":"Violet Talisman","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/violet-talisman/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/violet-talisman-e7.png","custom_title":"Long Battles","description":"Works better in fights that go longer than 3 turns."},{"title":"Moonlight Dreamblade","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/moonlight-dreamblade/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moonlight-dreamblade.png","custom_title":"Evade ","description":"Annoy opponents with higher evasion chance."}],"sets":[{"title":"Sustain","set_1":"Lifesteal","set_2":"Crit Rate","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Crit Damage%","ring":"Atk%","boots":"Atk%"},{"title":"Speed Demon","set_1":"Speed","set_2":"Crit Rate","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Crit Damage%","ring":"Atk%","boots":"Speed"},{"title":"Counter ","set_1":"Counter","set_2":"Crit Rate","set_3":"Choose","necklace":"Crit Damage%","ring":"Atk%","boots":"Atk%"}],"description":"<p><strong>Note (10/27/2022):</strong> S3 gets 3 turn attack and S1 now gets soul burn for extra turn.</p>\n<p>Remnant Violet is a good all round single target DPS.

They&#8217;re solidly about as strong as Rem, and we all know how busted she is. It was prophesized that Milim was going to be the Violet-killer of this meta, but as it turns out, Rimuru was the one to do so. This is mainly because of their S3, &#8220;Devour it, Black Flame!&#8221;, which not only is unaffected by elemental disadvantage, but will have at least 5,000 extra fixed damage at the end of the attack. However, depending on the amount of buffs on your ally team, that extra damage can go up to 10,000.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been figured out that you need 8 buffs in total for the full 10,000 damage &#8211; note that this actually isn&#8217;t that hard to do at all! You&#8217;d only need 2 buffs on each unit in order to get the full 10,000 (e.g. using Sinful Angelica&#8217;s s3 with an Immunity Rimuru would be enough for 10,000 damage). On top of that, Rimuru copies 2 buffs after using a non-basic skill and applies it to all allies; if you trigger their S2&#8217;s attack, they&#8217;ll copy buffs off of the enemy, put it on allies, and <em>then</em> be able to use their S3. 10,000 damage is actually a lot; with the raw damage that their S3 puts in before the fixed damage, the full attack can easily be enough to take out or severely weaken DPS units, like Violet.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that, if the enemy they attack with their s3 is buffed, they&#8217;ll also break the defenses of the rest of the enemy team!</p>\n<p>One downside to this is that the fixed damage increase only works with buffs there at the <em>start</em> of the turn. In other words, you can&#8217;t use Rimuru&#8217;s s3, copy buffs with it, and then get the 10,000 damage. You&#8217;ll have to wait until everyone has 2 buffs before you can get the full 10k.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to build Rimuru as a tank unit with no damage!

However, having some bulk in them is still recommended, so they don&#8217;t immediately die.

Pyllis has always been an extremely high-defense bruiser unit, who specializes in Provoking and&#8230; well, defense-oriented content. With her specialty change and rune tree, she&#8217;s become much better at this job!</p>\n<p>She kept her old &#8220;gains more defense whenever she&#8217;s hit&#8221; part of her passive, and increases the defense of her allies for every fourth hit she takes. However, the real benefits mostly come from her s3, Perceptive Slash (that doesn&#8217;t mean the rest of her kit isn&#8217;t useful &#8211; quite the opposite, actually), which removes a debuff from all allies before attacking her chosen enemy, Provoking them for a turn and granting a barrier on her allies for 2 turns, proportionate to her defense.</p>\n<p>When you max out her skill tree, Perceptive Slash will gain a 45% increased Hit Chance rate, and she&#8217;ll gain an extra 30% Hit Chance in general. This means Perceptive Slash has a shocking <em>75% Hit Rate!</em> Pair it up with A Symbol of Unity or Oath Key, and we&#8217;re looking at a 95% chance to land Perceptive Slash! This is incredibly useful in the meta of heavy-Evade units (such as Violet), as it can help target particularly pesky units and make them focus on Pyllis herself. Overall, Shadow Knight Pyllis has a nice spot in the meta as of this writing, and it&#8217;s worth doing her Specialty Change if you&#8217;re in late-game arena and struggling with Evasion units.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, you want Pyllis <em>tanky</em>.

There are two glaring problems with her skillset: firstly, her skillset doesn&#8217;t have any outright healing in her kit. Her s1 can help sustain herself, and her s2 balances out everyone&#8217;s HP (so this way one unit isn&#8217;t being singled out and left at 5% HP while everyone else is at 90% or higher), and her S3 is a whole other topic we&#8217;ll have to get into in a moment. However, there&#8217;s no skill of hers that actually heals her allies.</em></p>\n<p><em>This already sets up a massive problem in Shuna: without any form of actual healing in her kit, she&#8217;s outshined by units who do what her first 2 skills do but better (Emilia, Ray, Maid Chloe, etc.). You&#8217;d need to use artifacts as a source of healing for her kit, such as Celestine or Unfading Memories.

It takes at least 3 turns to charge up for (S2 -&gt; S1 -&gt; S1 to get 5 Focus), removes 2 buffs off of all enemies, and&#8230; puts them to Sleep for 2 turns. It&#8217;s worth noting that Shuna doesn&#8217;t even have a 100% chance to put her enemies after full skillups &#8211; if you fully skill up her s3, she still only has a 75% chance max to put them to Sleep.

His flagship skill comes from his S3, Execute, which increases his Hit Rate and Crit Rate by 50% and grants him Invincibility. The injuries part of his s3 isn&#8217;t as high priority, though. Zahhak boasts that both of his attacking skills grant him an extra 50% Crit Rate &#8211; which lowers his need for Crit Rate in his stats &#8211; along with high damage multipliers and an s3 that has a much lower chance to be Evaded!</p>\n<p>As of this writing, Epic 7 is in a heavy Evasion meta; Violet particularly has been the bane of many players&#8217; existence. Although Zahhak isn&#8217;t <em>guaranteed</em> to hit Violet, he still has a much higher chance than most units would. On top of that, due to already having a base 50% Crit Rate built in, you only need about 50% Crit Rate on his actual stats, which leaves more room for other damage-dealing stats! Also, his S2 now provides him an extra turn and some CR push for another ally, allowing him to use S2 into S3 combo if needed.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Build Notes</h4>\n<p>Building Zahhak is both easier and harder than building an average DPS unit. It&#8217;s easier because you only need to have 50% Crit Rate in his stats (similar to Lena), and his base stats when he&#8217;s 6-stars and fully awakened gives him a <em>shockingly </em>high 27% Crit Rate. However, because his Crit Rate necessities are so low, the goalposts for his other damage-dealing stats are much higher. The only build for him is <strong>Speed/Penetration</strong>, with CRIT DMG%/ATK%/SPD. If you don&#8217;t have any Penetration sets right now, you can use Crit Rate or Immunity until you get a Penetration set.</p>\n<p>The ideal Zahhak stats looks to be about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4,100+ ATK (More is always better)</li>\n<li>900~ DEF</li>\n<li>8,800~ HP</li>\n<li>250~ Speed</li>\n<li>50% Crit Rate</li>\n<li>300% Crit Damage</li>\n</ul>\n","rarity":"5","rating":{"world":"7","abyss":"7","boss":"7","raid":"7","arena":"9","guild_wars":"9"},"class":"Warrior","element":"Earth","link":"https://epic7x.com/character/zahhak/"},{"name":"Zealot Carmainerose","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zealot-Carmainerose-icon.png","tierlist_artifacts":[{"title":"Kal&#8217;adra","link":"https://epic7x.com/artifact/kaladra/","image":"https://epic7x.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kaladra.png","custom_title":"More Damage","description":"Always a nice artifact to have on her, as it increases her damage big time against debuffed units.
