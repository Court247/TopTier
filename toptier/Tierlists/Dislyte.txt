His passive can reverse the effect of max HP ceiling reduction effects, making him extremely useful against Fafnir and espers like Luo Yan and Hyde.\nHe has 3 hits on his skill 1, which helps break the shield of Fafnir. If your ally is frozen and max Hp ceiling is applied, he will remove it over time. He will also remove the anti-heal debuff, which will help your ally survive much better. His healing always targets allies with the lowest HP, so you cannot select who to heal.\nHis skill 3 heals the entire team and reduces everyone's skill cooldown by 1 turn and is not affected by other skills that increase or decrease cooldowns. This is great, especially for allies that have low skill cooldowns as it will enable to to spam their skill more often.\nThe sword avatara set is very good on him, as when he counters, he will heal an ally and also reduce the max HP ceiling penalty if they have it.\nAhmed is a staple in Fafnir. He has 3 hits on skill 1 and since his skill 3 has a long cooldown, he will use skill 1 most of the time. When Fafnir applies his max HP ceiling penalty, Ahmed reverses it.\nAs for stats to focus on, I suggest:\n\n35k+ HP\n1.2k+ Defense\n160+ Speed (more is better)\n\nHere is an example run that you can see him helping Tang Yun survive. He also improved my Fafnir 10 auto success from 30-40% to about 80%.\n        \n            \n        \n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/ahmed/","stats":{"hp":"910","atk":"15948","def":"754","speed":"94"}},{"id":"202","name":"Alexa","title":"Aphrodite","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/alexa-icon.jpg","class":"Support","element":"Inferno","rarity":"4","rating":{"story":"6","sonic_miracle":"7","kronos":"2","apep":"2","fafnir":"2","temporal":"7.5","point_war_pvp":"7.5","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Speed Utility","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Adamantine","description":"All allies start battle with a Shield equal to 15% of max HP.

Every time her team or herself gets hit by a critical hit, they get an AP push once every turn. This means if the enemy chooses to cleave, granted that there is no AP pushback from the opposing team, there is a potential to cut in and counter cleave or disrupt the cleave. Also, the enemy needs to crit for that to happen. Units like Tiye, Long Mian, Pritzker or Lucas usually don't have much crit, so there is a bit of RNG there. The second part of the passive is that if any of your ally crits, it also reduces the enemy AP.\nHer S3 gives the entire team attack buff and gives def + shield buff to herself. Her S2 can apply attack down and also stun the enemy if they have less attack than her. Her S1 can apply speed down. Her kit is quite loaded and for me, she is an offensive version of Gabrielle.\nIt is best to build her with high speed and attack, granted that her s3 shield scales off her own attack. Having high speed also means that she has a much better chance to cut into enemy cleave teams in PvP.\nHowever, she can also be built as a pure AoE DPS if needed.\n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/ashley/","stats":{"hp":"11632","atk":"1264","def":"860","speed":"106"}},{"id":"1974","name":"Aurelius","title":"Ullr","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/07/aurelius-icon1.jpg","class":"Fighter","element":"Flow","rarity":"4","rating":{"story":"5","sonic_miracle":"6","kronos":"5","apep":"3","fafnir":"6","temporal":"6","point_war_pvp":"7","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Speed Utility","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["ATK%","C.

It then pushes the entire team up based on the number of buffs stripped. Skill 2 can stun a unit while skill 1 can reduce their AP. She controls the battlefield through AP manipulation and also hard crowd control 1 unit.\nSince she is element neutral, she is very reliable at landing debuffs and buff strips with high accuracy. The only thing inconsistent about her is the AP push. It is not 100% reliable at pushing up. It is possible that she doesn't strip any buffs if enemy built high resist on their characters. However, it is not likely in lower level PvP, so she stays very relevant even at higher PvP.\nAlso, she is actually viable in Fafnir as she has multi hits on skills 1 and 2, with 3 stripping the immunity off Fafnir.\n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/bonnie/","stats":{"hp":"13721","atk":"910","def":"912","speed":"105"}},{"id":"2282","name":"Brewster","title":"Garmr","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/11/brewster-icon.png","class":"Fighter","element":"Inferno","rarity":"5","rating":{"story":"7.5","sonic_miracle":"7","kronos":"8","apep":"7","fafnir":"4","temporal":"7.5","point_war_pvp":"7","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Full Damage","4-set":{"ID":82,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:53:26","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:53:26","post_content":"","post_title":"Hammer of Thor","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"hammer-of-thor","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:42:43","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:42:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=82","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["C.

Her skill 3 is an AoE attack that can sleep all enemies and reduce their AP. Skill 1 can also sleep. Her skill 2 is where she provides good utility where it cleanses 1 debuff from all allies and gives speed and defense buff. The speed up buff is really good as it makes your entire team move faster and get more turns over time.\nWhile she is tailored for PvP, she is very useful in PvE content as well. The temporal tower and cube miracles are places where she shine since she can sleep key targets and delay them from using potential deadly skills. Even in story mode, she can help you clear harder stages when under levelled due to sleep.\nIn PvP, she can be the opener to reduce enemy AP and potentially sleep all enemies.

This means that she can put on immunity, but it isn't useful if enemies already debuffed you.

She can also give a shield from extra healing when ally has full health.\nHer skill 1 can heal 2 allies and is quite useful to sustain low health units, especially the DPS. She needs to be built relatively fast, but doesn't always have to go first as she can push AP and heal, so she is meant to push allies forward after some have taken damage.\nHaving said that, she excels in most PvE and also PvP content.

He requires high crit rate and damage to be able to capitalize on his skill 3. He can hit up to 3 enemies if they die after getting attacked. For skill 2, he can defense break he enemy. This is good as you comb skill 2 into either 3 or 1 depending on the situation.\nHe does not have much health, so surviving will be hard unless you can kill enemies quickly. He also is quite useful in the arena due to his snowball nature in skill 3. Add on turn cycling on skill 2 and 3 will mean a strong F2p unit.\nDue to his type, he is ideal for both Kronos and Apep, bringing the defense break as utility and can serve as the primary or secondary DPS. This makes him one of the better choices to 6 star early on to help you get to Kronos 10 runs much quicker early game.\n        \n            \n        \n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/drew/","stats":{"hp":"10343","atk":"1144","def":"810","speed":"91"}},{"id":"373","name":"Eira","title":"Freya","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/freya-icon.jpg","class":"Support","element":"Flow","rarity":"4","rating":{"story":"6","sonic_miracle":"8","kronos":"9","apep":"5","fafnir":"3","temporal":"8","point_war_pvp":"7","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Speed Utility","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Apollo's Bow","description":"ACC +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/apollos-bow.jpg"},"mui_ii":["SPD"],"description":"Allows her to land debuffs and also be fast enough to heal/cleanse allies.","4_set":{"title":"Wind Walker","description":"SPD +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/wind-walker.jpg"}},{"title":"Skill Cycling Support","4-set":{"ID":69,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:43:23","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:43:23","post_content":"","post_title":"Ocean Waves","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ocean-waves","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:35:57","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:35:57","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=69","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Adamantine","description":"All allies start battle with a Shield equal to 15% of max HP.

His skill cooldowns are low, so a Ocean Wave set can really cycle his skills very quickly if it procs. The other option is speed set.\nHis skill one can give recovery to the lowest health unit.

He does well in Cube Miracle and Temporal Tower since taunting key targets and applying attack down will help your team survive. He won't see much use in the Kronos, Apep and Fafnir as his kit isn't great for them.\nAs for PvP, he now has speed lead skill.

His normal form is good at applying debuffs. His normal skill 1 can stun and extend all debuffs, which is great when paired with other debuffers. His skill 2 can dispel enemy buffs and buff block, which is super useful against all types of enemies.\nAlso, his skill 2 can hit for big damage against many enemies. Hitting the only target left is also okay, but damage will be reduced. This skill is strong in PvP due to the AoE effect and can either debuff or damage at the same time. It really keeps the enemy on their toes.\nHis skill 3 is where the magic happens, where switching from normal mode to God King mode turns him into a damage machine. His skill 2 will hit really hard and thanks to the crit rate of 100% bonus, you can stack as much crit damage as you can on him, that allows him to deal a lot of damage.\nDue to not having to build crit rate, he can free up a lot of stats for other good ones like HP, DEF and Speed. This allows your Gaius to not be so squishy as well. He performs really well in purgatory 12 training mode and can clear under 1 minute with really good crit damage gear.\nHe can be used in pretty much all game modes effectively except for Apep.

Because of this, he is quite good against Fafnir boss since it requires multi hit to break its shield. Aside from that, Hall is also good when he is partner with a lot of supports and he actually deals decent damage when it is not his turn.\nThe biggest drawback is that his skill 3 is random. While applying defense break is good, but it would be nice if we can select our target. Skill 1 applying attack down really helps with hard hitting bosses.\nHis passive once ascended can apply poison to enemies, which is quite useful against big bosses in story mode. He isn't good in PvP as poison isn't great there and it is easily countered by cleanse or immunity.

He can deal a lot of damage due to his passive. He can share damage with his allies, allowing him to take damage and deal more damage as his health decreases. Since he has standoff after taking the first lethal hit and enters Demon Mode, he cleanses all debuffs and now can ignore defense of the enemy. While you cannot control him in Demon Mode, a high damage build Jiang Jiuli will one shot any unit, including tanks thanks to ignore defense.\nHe can also be used as a fodder farmer in purgatory 10+ as he will get his passive up in time to ensure he doesn't die. When he is not in demon mode, his damage will just be like regular DPS. For cube miracle and Temporal Tower, he will shine. Being able to take damage will help your other allies survive and make life easier for your healers and buffers.\nHe does have his counters though. Triki's passive will kill him if he removes his standoff buff. Also, other units like Pritzker or Bonnie who can increase skill cooldown will be able to ensure he cannot use his passive, thus dying after taking the first lethal hit.\nAs for builds:\n\n3k+ Attack\n20k+ HP\n1.2k+ Defense\n80%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n150+ Speed\n\nThis will suffice in terms of being a DPS. It also helps if he can get more health. Having 100% crit rate is ideal, but that will come with farming over time. Good sets on him are Thor for damage, Ocean Waves for cooldown reduction and Snow Dowager for PvP.

Her skill 1 is simple as it can stun.\nWhile her kit looks solid in general, I think cleansers and immunity really stops her from doing damage, if any at all. The 12-8 boss is a good example of her usage there.

He excels in Kronos as well , which is vital in getting the key equipment you need to gear your team.

First of all, she is a strong single target DPS even without debuffs due to her multipliers. She doesn't have any elemental disadvantage, so no misses.\nHer skill 3 is stacked with a defense break and speed down. Skill 2 can land up to 4 bleed stacks. Skill 1 can prevent enemy healing. With so many debuffs, she is just too good in terms of utility. Many other single target attackers don't have similar utility compared to her when it comes to all 3 skills.\nOnce you pull her, she can be used in both PvE and PvP content, making her the best bang for your buck. Kronos becomes easy if she is the lead attacker. She also doesn't need crit rate since Tiger's Roar gives her attacks permanent 100% crit for 3 turns. Relic wise, she can just focus on crit damage and as much attack you can get. Speed on her is a bonus.\n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/lin-xiao/","stats":{"hp":"11294","atk":"1224","def":"794","speed":"95"}},{"id":"562","name":"Long Mian","title":"Ao Bing","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/long-mian-icon.jpg","class":"Controller","element":"Wind","rarity":"4","rating":{"story":"9","sonic_miracle":"9.5","kronos":"5","apep":"4","fafnir":"3","temporal":"9.5","point_war_pvp":"10","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Speedy Utility","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%","ATK%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Apollo's Bow","description":"ACC +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/apollos-bow.jpg"},"mui_ii":["SPD"],"description":"Allows him to go first and crowd control the enemies.","4_set":{"title":"Wind Walker","description":"SPD +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/wind-walker.jpg"}},{"title":"Stun","4-set":{"ID":78,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:51:35","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:51:35","post_content":"","post_title":"Tyranny of Zeus","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"tyranny-of-zeus","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:46:13","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:46:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=78","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%","ATK%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Apollo's Bow","description":"ACC +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/apollos-bow.jpg"},"mui_ii":["SPD"],"description":"Allows him to stun for some more crowd control.","4_set":{"title":"Tyranny of Zeus","description":"Damage dealt has a 20% chance of Stunning the target for 1 turn.","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/tyranny-of-zeus.jpg"}},{"title":"PvP","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%","ATK%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"The Light Above","description":"Begins the battle with Immunity, which lasts for 1 turn.","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/the-light-above.jpg"},"mui_ii":["SPD"],"description":"Prevents him from getting stunned or slowed.","4_set":{"title":"Wind Walker","description":"SPD +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/wind-walker.jpg"}}],"description":"Long Main is a very strong controller that excels in both PvE and PvP content, except for the big boss hunts (Kronos/Apep/Fafnir).

The only downside to him is if you want to build him with some damage as well. It will require good sub stats. However, even without damage, he does very well and is used is most content except for Apep and Fafnir.\nHis best partners are any other AP boosters that can make sure he goes next ahead of the team. Unas and Fabrice are a few that pairs well with him.\nBelow is a damage build by Kovian where he uses Lucas and Sanders to 2 man Kronos.

First of all, she is a very good farmer and can help level your other characters once she gets going. I suggest giving her the best attack or lifesteal set given to you (upgrade them to +12) in chapters 6 and 8 to make sure she can clear maps by herself with 4 other fodders or weaker units.\nThis is very valuable as she can clear maps faster than most units and thus fast leveling. She is extremely self-sufficient with her skill 2 healing herself as well. Lifesteal set is not mandatory but the free gear is good since it gives Crit Rate and Atk% bonus.\nMaking her your first 6 star is highly recommended, even ahead of any 5 star rarity heroes you might have pulled initially. Having her being able to carry your entire team and level quickly is too good to pass up. With high enough damage, she can one shot units with skill 1 and gain an extra turn. This snowballs and allows you to cycle your skills quickly. The AI is also decent in auto as well. And early on, she is vital in getting you to Kronos 7, which is the first level where you can find 6 star grade equipment.\n        \n            \n        \n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/mona/","stats":{"hp":"9680","atk":"1255","def":"860","speed":"97"}},{"id":"288","name":"Narmer","title":"Ra","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/narmer-icon.jpg","class":"Fighter","element":"Inferno","rarity":"5","rating":{"story":"7.5","sonic_miracle":"9","kronos":"9","apep":"8.5","fafnir":"3","temporal":"9","point_war_pvp":"9.5","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Offense","4-set":{"ID":54,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:39:24","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:39:24","post_content":"","post_title":"War Machine","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"war-machine","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:43:51","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:43:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=54","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["C.

However, if you can max her skills out, she definitely will outperform Tang Yun in terms of consistent damage out put.\n","link":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/character/ophelia/","stats":{"hp":"12588","atk":"1244","def":"811","speed":"97"}},{"id":"540","name":"Pritzker","title":"Mimir","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/pritzker-icon.jpg","class":"Controller","element":"Inferno","rarity":"4","rating":{"story":"9","sonic_miracle":"9.5","kronos":"3","apep":"3","fafnir":"2","temporal":"10","point_war_pvp":"10","holobattle":""},"sets":[{"title":"Speed Utility","4-set":{"ID":58,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:41:12","post_content":"","post_title":"Wind Walker","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"wind-walker","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:36:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=58","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["HP%"],"una_iv":["ACC%","HP%"],"2_set":{"title":"Apollo's Bow","description":"ACC +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/apollos-bow.jpg"},"mui_ii":["SPD"],"description":"Goes fast so he can AoE stun enemies.","4_set":{"title":"Wind Walker","description":"SPD +25%","image":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/05/wind-walker.jpg"}},{"title":"Damage Dealer with Utility","4-set":{"ID":54,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-05-13 13:39:24","post_date_gmt":"2022-05-13 13:39:24","post_content":"","post_title":"War Machine","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"war-machine","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-05-13 19:43:51","post_modified_gmt":"2022-05-13 19:43:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https://gachax.com/dislyte/?post_type=equipment&#038;p=54","menu_order":0,"post_type":"equipment","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"una_ii":["C.

In Temporal Tower, her damage reduction comes in clutch alongside her debuff cleanses.\nIn PvP, you are going to need specific units to counter her, especially if you rely on debuffs to destroy enemies.

This can be unreliable at times but it is a nice added bonus. Since he has debuffs, he will also need some accuracy, especially in end game content. Otherwise, it can be given up and just focus on his offensive stats.

His skills revolve around triggering skill 1. When he uses skill 2 and 3, there is a chance that skill 1 will trigger. When it triggers, skill 1 can trigger at a 30% chance. That means in some rare cases, he can attack up to 7-8 times in a row. That makes him really good against Fafnir.\nHis skill 2 ignores defense, so he can take on very tanky units and destroy them. Because of this, he is a key candidate in both PvE and PvP content when it comes to dealing with tough and tanky units. I would say he is a 5 star in disguise.

On skill 1, she can defense break. Her skill 2 can bleed if it crits and can transfer all debuffs to the ally. Her skill 3 does bonus damage the more debuffs that are stacked.\nThis means she will pair well with other debuffers like Long Mian, Lewis, Jiang Man etc. She becomes less useful when enemy has immunity or cleanse. However, if you have a buff stripper and stack debuffs, she will be doing more damage. In a way, she is the budget version of Chloe.\nIn PvE content, she excels in both Apep and Fafnir. Fafnir requires multi hit and both her skill 1 and 2 are multi hits. Apep is a poison fiesta, so she can transfer debuffs back to the boss.\nFor PvP, she will need more setup and can be hard to fit into a team.

Her skill 2 scales very well with crit rate and crit damage, allowing her to deal lots more damage. Her skill 3 can inflict buff block.\nThe key thing about her is to keep her HP above 50% for the guaranteed extra cast of skill 1.
