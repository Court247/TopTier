      "description": "Abigail is a strong protector for the backline while being able to dish out injuries with her skills. She has a lot of utility. Her skill 3 can dispel all buffs from the enemy target and apply injuries.\nHer passive protects the backline from getting 1 shot and apply immortality. It does come at the cost of a high turn cooldown. She scales very well with health and it also allows her to be tanky. Protecting the backline role usually comes from a knight, so having the warrior role will allow her to use some good warrior artifacts such as Snow Crystal to make her even tankier.\nHer skill one increases combat readiness for herself + her allies if Might activates. Her skills combined makes her a good alternative tank in PvP mode. In terms of PvE, she has limited use but can be utilized like other tanks.\nFor stats:\n\n1.5k+ Defense\n25k+ Health\n150+ Speed\nAny effect resistance will help\n\nThese are the key important stats you want for her as the main tank.\n",

      "description": "Abyssal Yufine is strictly for PvP. Her kit is quite interesting as it requires a specific stat (defense) over 2000 for her special effect (Trauma) to double in effectiveness. Do keep in mind that she is stat hungry and needs a lot to work well. That means she is mostly for end game players who have farmed top gear for her.\nHer passive severely reduce combat readiness push units and therefore is very good at stopping fast, cleaving teams that rely on CR pushing to get their first turn. Since she will also counter attack when hit, she can land attack down debuff thanks to her skill one. Plus, she auto cleanses herself when her fighting spirit is full (if she keeps getting attacked).\nHer skill 3 is where she gets to push back all enemies and dispel all their buffs, alongside some nice damage while gaining trauma. As strong as it is, it will be rare to use it in live PvP matches.\nAs for stats, she is reliant on getting at least 2k defense:\n\nAny Attack\n2000+ Defense\n15k+ Health\n100% Crit Rate\n220%+ Crit Damage\n150+ Speed\nAny effect resist is bonus\n\nIf you can pump in more crit damage, health and effect resistance, it would be great. Her goal is to land as many counters as possible against AoE attackers while keeping herself alive.\n;\n",

      "description": "(Written 11-27-21)\nAdin;s been out for a few weeks at this point, and it;s been decided that she;s pretty good! She;s not going to be game-breaking or anything that makes a new meta, but that doesn;t mean she;s bad; not at all, actually. She;s decided to be more of a niche unit, but she;s really good in Banshee teams, due to her s3 breaking defense, increasing Attack, and using the unique buff Weakness Shared.\nHowever, there;s still more in store for Adin ; as Episode 4 goes on, she;ll even be able to start changing elements! Right now, we don;t know what that entails, so we can;t say anything for certain about the elementally-changed Adin, and instead just her Earth variant.\nBuild Notes\nStrangely, even though she;s found some use in Banshee one-shot teams, there;s no perfect one-size-fits-all build for her yet. She;s easy enough to build, though; you just need to have generic DPS gear on her, with a focus on Attack%, the Crits%, and Speed. Speed/Crit is a good build for her, but some people have put her on Speed/Penetration before.\nNote: If you;re going to be using her in a Banshee team, then she only needs 85% Crit Rate in order to guarantee a crit! This is because, as of right now, she has the elemental advantage against the Banshee.\n[2/17/2022 Update] ; Weakness Shared cannot be dispelled.\n",

The key is him being a decent tank that can dual attack using his skill 2 with some of your strongest DPS units and a chance to defense break for 1 turn as well. This means he is a good option for those that are not lucky to get Lilias. He also grants immunity for both the ally and himself when dual attacking with command strike. This is great, especially in Guild Wars.\nHe is also a staple for Golem as he can pair with any strong fire DPS to dish out damage quickly to the Golem while protecting them as well. His specialty change also improved his health, giving him good survivability too.\nHis skill 3 remains roughly the same with slightly better damage, better healing and a slight combat readiness push.\nOverall, he is a huge upgrade and is worthy of using now.  😉\n",

She can be used in both PvE (Banshee mostly) and PvP, so new players who need a single target damage dealer can also consider getting her.\nHer skill 3 nuke ignores damage sharing effects and has a high damage multiplier. High crit damage and crit rate is a must for this one. Failure to kill the enemy means you do not get the extra turn. She also gets a self attack buff and gives the ally with the highest attack an attack buff as well. This happens after her S3 attack though, so she will need another attack buffer boost her own attack if you want her to hit hard.\nHer passive cleanses one debuff and boosts increase combat readiness effects and therefore require less push than normal to get to 100%. Very good utility skill to have.\nHer skill 1 is a bit more unique, giving combat readiness to the highest attack ally instead of herself.\nOverall, she needs super high damage. That means she will be squishy and therefore needs protection. Here is a baseline of the stats you should be aiming for.\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n1k+ Defense\n8k+ HP\n100% Crit Rate\n300% Crit Damage\n130+ Speed\n\nIf you can get more speed, then great.

      "description": "ae-KARINA is a defensive based knight that scales her damage off defense and with her own artifact, she can deal extra damage based on her defense as well, making it a good bruiser damage item. It acts much like Uberius Tooth, but much suited for defense type scaling units like Fighter Maya, ML Cermia etc.\nHer skill 3 is a single target damage attack that can defense break and  later deals additional damage to other enemies. The damage will depend on how well you scale her crit rate and crit damage if you build her as a damage dealer. Even without crit rate and crit damage, it is quite decent for a tank/bruiser. She also gains speed buff after using the skill as well.\nHer skill 2 passive will grant her a self defense buff and a barrier to all allies based off her own defense. It won;t be too thick since defense is much harder to scale than attack. This passive also pushes her up a bit.\nHer skill 1 can also defense break as well. Having 2 skills with defense break, it is super useful in most content, and this includes PvE and PvP. She can be a Wyvern tank and apply defense break for the team.\nFor a decent build:\n\n15k+ HP\n2k+ Defense\n80%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n65%+ Effectiveness\n150+ Speed\n\nThis is a rough guideline for a damage dealer type. Her best in slot artifact is her own artifact Rocket Punch no doubt. Other good alternatives such as Noble Oath for tankiness at lower hp and Proof of Valor for tanking Wyvern.\n",

      "description": "After having a week of ae-NINGNING, she seems to be a rather balanced unit. She has a lot of uses in end game play mostly. New players that are still doing most PvE content are much better off with units like Tamarinne.\nHer S3 is similar to DJ Basar, with the barrier inversion on top of dispelling 2 buffs on all enemies. Do keep in mind that it is a non attack skill, so it doesn;t do damage if the enemy has no barrier.\nHer S2 is quite similar to Emilia, but you cannot choose who to give the attack buff and combat readiness push to. It will go to the highest attack unit. However, she can decrease enemy combat readiness as well. Her S1 provides a basic stun.\nThe thing with her kit is that she does not have any healing, much like Diene. That being said, she cannot be compared to traditional healer/buffer like Destina or Tamarinne since she is more of a support.\nDue to the barrier inversion, she is much suited for end game content in PvP, especially against barrier teams.\nWith that said, a decent build is:\n\n1.2k+ DEF\n13k+ HP\n220+ Speed\n50%+ Effectiveness\n\nBest set is still speed and she needs to go first in PvP to cast her barrier inversion. More effectiveness is always going to be good on her especially in PvP.\n",

      "description": "ae-Winter is a well-balanced limited thief available to players willing to pull for her. She excels in longer battles and does not require much attack power to do damage thanks to her S3 fixed damage scaling.\nShe also has low base attack, so building attack on her is not ideal. It is much better to build her with more defensive stats to improve her survivability and deal more damage by stacking S3 quickly, especially when her passive activates.\nHer passive allows her to self cleanse debuffs and gain immunity + stealth after the enemy uses a non attack skill. It also resets her S3 cooldown. The best way to use her is to have her be the opening attacker. This way, she can use her S3, then enemy can potentially activate her passive and allow her to use S3 again. This is great against non-attack type enemy teams.\nBoth her S1 and S3 can stun (with S3 being 2 turn stun), so she can pair well with units like ML Sez for some ignore defense. In addition to that, she can soul burn S1 for guaranteed stun (minus resistance).\nAs for stats, you will want something like this:\n\n1.5k+ Attack\n1.2+ Defense\n15k+ HP\n250+ Speed\n100% Crit Rate\nAny bonus effectiveness aside from awakening\n\nThis will allow her to go first with a speed lead, allowing her to stun key targets on the opposing team.\n",

Her attacks scale off HP, so you can stack a lot of health and make her durable.\nHer S3 clears all enemy;s buffs and give her team a defense buff. This means she provides tankiness for your team and negate enemy buffs. Her passive is now changed. She gains Mind;s Eye at the start of the turn and loses it at the end of the turn when using her S1. Her damage is also slightly lowered, although I think they should have kept the old multiplers.\nShe now can hit decently well with her S1 when the unit is defense broken.

      "description": "Amid is not really made for new players and is strictly catered to end game players who have already completed most of the PvE content available in the game.\nHer skill 3 is similar to Emilia;s skill 2, except that it has longer cooldown and provides the special 50% CR push to one unit on their turn. This means that this is a built in attack buff that can cleanse 2 debuffs and give specific units like Ludwig, ML Sez, Kise, Aramintha, Pirate Captain Flan and Rem. These units have 50% CR boost on their skills, so having the special swift buff will mean they will go back to back, allowing them to combo their skills.\nHer skill 2 can provide a team wide skill nullifier and CR push for all allies. It does come with an extra turn, so the high skill cooldown isn;t too bad.\nHer skill 1 gives additional CR boost for herself. Much of her weakness lies in not having any heals and she is purely a support unit for end game PvP niche units.\nStat wise, you want her to be as fast as possible since she has high base speed for a soul weaver.\n\n1.2k Defense\n15k+ HP\n250+ Speed (if you can)\nAny effect resistance is a bonus\n\nThe rest of her stats aren;t too important. Overall, she is only worth pulling if you are in PvP end game. Otherwise, it is an easy skip for new players.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/22/21)\nIt;s been about two weeks since Angel of Light Angelica;s release, but since then she;s already proved herself to be a very oppressive unit in Arena and RTA. Her kit is pretty much overloaded, but the real stars of the show are her passive and S3.\nHer passive makes her completely immune to being Stunned, for one thing. On top of that, she completely punishes anyone using AoE attacks by increasing her Combat Readiness by 8% for every ally except the caster attacked; when she;s hit with an attack that hits all allies, she;ll activate a part of her passive called Guardian Angel (though, you gotta fully skill up her passive for the 100% activation chance) that dispels a debuff from all allies and grants them skill nullifier once. The downside of this is that Guardian Angel only activates once every 3 turns, so there;s a couple turns of downtime for it.\nFinally, we have her s3, which dispels two buffs from all enemies, before silencing them and making them unbuffable for 2 turns. (Again, 100% chance when skilled up.) Her s3 deals no damage, meaning that it can;t land as a Miss ; all it has to worry about is the Effectiveness/Resistance check, similarly to Flan;s s3. On top of that, due to dealing 0 damage, she can;t trigger any other units that punish AoE units (such as Inferno Khawazu or Rem).\nShe;s used solely for PvP use, but she really shines there, as you can see. Angel of Light Angelica can completely shut down the enemy units and leave them unable to use anything except their basic skills, along with punishing them should they resist her Silence and pop off with an AoE attack.\nBuild Notes\nYou want her to be fast and with high Effectiveness. Her Speed and EFF% are her two most important substats to focus on, although you don;t want to neglect her bulk. She;s meant to be a fast, tanky opener, meaning it;d do you good to put her on a Speed set. Depending on your gear quality, her second set should be either Hit or Immunity. Although Immunity can be a bit of a safety net, using Hit as a second-set can ease up on the Effectiveness% you need to get from her gear.\nA very good, late-game Angel of Light Angelica build looks to be about:\n\n15,000+ HP\n1,600 Defense\n270+ Speed at the least\n180% Effectiveness at the least\n\nNote that this build requires high gear quality, and is for late-game players. However, it can be used as a goalpost to work towards for your own Angel of Light Angelica.\nNote: Due to her s3 doing no actual damage, popular Mage artifacts like Abyssal Crown and Iela Violin can;t work on her.\n",

Since it has a short cooldown at 3 turns and she also gains 50% combat readiness, she can quickly cycle the skills and cleanse when necessary. Her skill 2 now also heals even if no debuffs are cleansed.\nShe will be very useful in content where there are heavy debuffs. She will shine against Banshee and Azimanak Hunt. She is also viable for Wyvern but not as effective as say Angelica. She will also be a great addition against Karkanis in raid. Abyss is also another area where she will be useful.\nIn PvP, she can be used against debuff heavy units like ML Aramintha and Dizzy. Her skill tree upgrade gives her an additional base effect resistance of 40%. So she can be built up to 150%+ effect resistance to counter them. She is a great utility healer that can be used in many matchups.\n",

She gives your entire team heal + debuff immunity for 2 turns and can be extended to 4 turns.

So stack as much health as you can on her.\nHer first skill is a small chance to stun, which is useful sometimes in getting some lucky stuns on key enemies. The only downside of Angelica is that she has a slow base speed.\nShe can be used everywhere from Abyss, Raid, Wyvern and even Golem if you needed her there. She is fairly obtainable via selective summon so that is a plus.\nHowever, with the emergence of specialty change Angelic Montmorancy, she isn;t mandatory as a must have re-roll unit.

The revived hero can then instantly move, which can be very dangerous.\nHer passive allows her to take more damage and sustain herself with heals. Running counter set or pure high hp (20k+) and decent defense and effect resistance is the way to go. She doesn;t do good damage if you can;t get high enough crit rate and critical damage alongside 20k+ hp. With the new changes, she is much easier to gear as she now gets a flat 30% crit rate bonus passive.\nA well built ML Ravi is strong on offense as a light bait and also to tank other attacks.

Passive also gets slight CR push %.\nHer S3 now inflicts 2 burn stacks with 70% chance to stun. After that, it gives her a thick barrier based off her attack. Her S2 is where she shines. It now strips 2 buffs + apply unhealable, gives her allies attack buff, and more importantly, gives a +30% CR push per unhealable inflicted. Against a 4 man enemy team, she will most likely get 80% CR push for the most part. That means she can go almost instantly again.\nHer S1 inflicts burn. Losing the detonate effect seems like a nerf to me (since you need her option 2 Exclusive Equipment to detonate burns), but will require testing to see if the increased stun chance on S3 is well worth it.\nShe is also great against Golem in PvE as well. With the buff strip and unhealable, she can be the buff stripper, attack buffer and damage dealer at the same time.\nStats wise, I recommend:\n\n3k+ Attack\n1.2k+ Defense\n10k+ HP\n180-230+ Speed\n65%+ Effectiveness\n\nYou won;t need crit rate or crit damage, so gearing her should be a lot easier than traditional DPS.

      "description": "(Updated on 7-27-22)\nAria is the first mage that is released that scales off defense. That means she can be built tanky and dish out some good damage. The good thing is she is very versatile and can fit into any team composition by building her around that team (fast or bruiser team etc.).\nHer S3 provides her with self counterattack, self defense buff and then stealths + barrier her allies. This makes enemies that can only use single target attacks be forced to attack her, while she counters and build up her focus for the mega S2 passive attack.\nHer S2 passive gives her crit rate bonus (easier to gear), crit damage bonus(as her health lowers) and upon gaining 5 focus, she unleashes a powerful AoE attack that dispels 2 enemy buffs and push them back as well. Pretty good if you would ask me.\nHer S1 can hit 2 enemies and apply the hit chance debuff. Building her with some effectiveness and effect resistance as it is optional. Her awakening gives her some of those stats. However, for PvP, you may need them.\nBuild Notes\nAs for stats wise, here are the options:\n\n2k+ Defense\n10k+ HP\n100% Crit Rate\n200-300%+ Crit Dmg\n140-250 Speed\nAbout 100% Effect Resistance\n\nYou;ll want to tune Aria to the speed of her team, which is why her Speed is so varied. Generally, she is not fast enough to be the opener, but she can go second ahead of your buffer or CR pusher. If you want her as a bruiser, then she can be slower with more bulk and perhaps effect resistance to avoid getting her buffs stripped.\nHer biggest weakness is getting that counterattack buff taken off. It makes her vulnerable and easy to die to opposing damage dealers.\n",

      "description": "Update (14/4/2022)\nThe new armin is actually quite useful. Her S2 passive now gives allies protection to single target attacks. If she is attacked, she has a chance to counter attack with her S1, which turns into an AoE attack. Her S3 now loses the heal, but gets a barrier that scales off her defense. Not a big shield but it is better than nothing. Her S1 stays the same.\nBecause of her passive, she is best used against teams with a mix of AoE attacks and single target attacks. AoE attacks will increase her chances to counter attack for the stun, especially when you put her on Elbris Ritual Sword. If the enemy focuses your allies with single target attacks, they also take a lot less damage. Because of this, it is much better for her to be slightly slower than your team and use a counter set.\nAs such, I recommend the following:\n\n1.8k+ Defense\n16k+ Health\n105-140 Speed\n40%+ Effectiveness\n\nEffect resistance is optional. Her counters are pretty much RNG and can sometimes stun key opponents or do absolutely nothing.\n",

He also have some good uses in PvE, particularly Abyss and Raid to setup your DPS for big damage. When you;re building A.Lots, your main (and only) priority should be speed.

Any other substats can honestly take a backburner when building A.Lots: they;re beneficial, but not the main focus. Also make sure to fully skill up his S2, so it;s 100% Combat Readiness.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 14/5/21)\nUnfortunately, Baal and Sezan ; despite being a Selective Summon unit ; is not considered to be very good to most people. They are usable, however there are many units that outshine them and seem to do their job better for less investment. Baal and Sezan;s third skill, Last Requiem, does have a low cooldown of only 3 turns when skilled up, yes, but at the same time, the chances of applying their debuffs are only 65% at base, and can only be skilled up to 85%. This makes the debuff chances on their s3 unreliable, even if the debuffs themselves are pretty nice to have.\nIn PvE, there are a few places that one could use Baal ; Sezan in. He is okay as a farmer, due to his AoE skills and low cooldowns on his s2 and s3. Because he has so many debuffs, he can be usable in Raid or Abyss, though his Morale is kind of low when it comes to Raid. Apart from that, the place Baal ; Sezan are viable in is Golem Hunts ; a hunt that most people don;t really do much of, compared to Wyvern or Banshee.\nNote: He can also be used in the Grass Expedition as a primary debuffer.\nIn PVP, he;s outshined by many units who can do the job more reliably. Fire Tenebria and (as of recently) Flan are a few that come to mind. Overall, Baal ; Sezan is a unit that can be invested in, but if you have better units it;s not really recommended to put time and effort into them.\n;\n",

      "description": "Note (10/27/2022): She now has a provoke kit and her playstyle will change. Needs some testing.\nOutdated: Bad Cat Armin is in a bit of a weird spot. She has a pretty interesting kit that is essentially the reverse of Troublemaker Crozet ; instead of counterattacking when the ally in the back row is attacked, she makes the frontline ally counterattack when she;s hit. However, she is limited by the fact that her only real source of damage is her injuries, along with not having any Crowd Control on her kit. The amount of support she brings on her s3 is lackluster, on top of this; while her allies can certainly benefit from a Barrier, it just feels like something is missing.\nShe;s made to be a bit more of a supporter unit, yes, however Bad Cat Armin still needs a bit of tweaking before she can really shine. Despite this, she still has places where she can shine ; such as in niche PvP teams, but she;s not anything game breaking. Players who want to stray from the meta a bit can build her, as she can end up providing something interesting to the table.\nBuild Notes\nThere are two ways to build Bad Cat Armin ; as a pure tank or as more of a bruiser unit. The bruiser build is more or less the same as going with a tanky build, however her HP and DEF requirements are lower in exchange for needing Crit Chance and Crit DMG.\nFor a pure tank build, her stats should look something like this:\n\n22,000+ HP\n1,500+ DEF\n200+ Speed\n\nFor the bruiser build, stats will look more akin to this:\n\n20,000+ HP (More is better)\n1,300+ DEF\n200 Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n200% Crit DMG\n\n",

      "description": "Note: Limited Collab \nBaiken is a hybrid attacker. She has a skill kit that can provide combat readiness push for the team, apply bleeds and also deal some single target damage. She has decent base stats and can be utilised in the following ways:\n-Speed utility sub damage dealer and combat readiness pusher for speed PvP team\n-Single target nuker in Banshee, Golem and PvP via bleed and detonate\n-Single target nuker with high crit rate and crit damage (much like Karin) with bleed debuff as a bonus\nThe issue is that it requires very high gear quality to be able to use her entire skill set to maximum effect. For being an arena speed team as the first to move, she needs speed, 100% crit rate, high attack, critical damage and effectiveness. If she lacks attack or critical damage, her DPS will suffer. If her effectiveness is low, she will miss her bleeds and her detonate damage won;t do enough damage. If you focus on her attack stats, you might not get enough speed stats to move first.\nThat makes her not as effective, especially for new players since the same investment on say Karin would be much better in terms of damage output early game. New players don;t have the resources to get her 100% crit rate without sacrificing her other stats early on.\nHowever, her late game potential is really strong once you can gear her well. Therefore, it is suggested to build her later on when you have enough gear to get her to high enough stats.\n",

This means that he does very well when paired with at least 1 other burn specialist like Carrot, ML Flan and Aramintha etc. This is due to his passive improving all burn damage to enemies.\nHis skill 3 is a supportive type skill, which can dispel 2 enemy buffs while increasing his own and his allies combat readiness and apply cannot be buff debuff. This gives him the chance to contest as the opener to allow your team to go first. However, this works up to mid level PvP ranks as his base speed won;t cut it in the higher ranks. For PvE though, this skill is very good.\nHis skill one can detonate burn effects and also apply burn, but only on his turn and not during dual attacks or counterattacks. Since he only has his skill 1 being able to burn the enemy, his damage output is not the best. He cannot crit though, so he will be easy to build.\n\n12k+ HP\n3.5k+ Attack\n1.2k+ Defense\n220+ Speed\n65%+ Effectiveness\n\nAny other stats are not mandatory as he won;t be the main damage dealer. Having super high speed will help your entire team cycle their skills quicker.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 10/14/21)\nHaving two weeks to test Belian out, it;s become clear what her place in the meta is ; she;s an RTA bruiser, meant to completely block units from using their Souls and slowly whittle down the opponent. She;s very strong as a unit in Arena defense teams (though not as much as in Arena offense, as the defense doesn;t use soul-burns).\nSouls are a very prominent part of gameplay, so Belian completely deleting Souls as long as she;s alive is going to be more oppressive than, say, Solitaria blocking all Focus gain. However, she is countered by multiple things ; her passive only stays up if she;s alive (meaning once she dies, the enemy can start gaining Souls again), and her only-AoE skillset means she;s countered pretty heavily in this meta of units that punish you for just that.\nAll in all, Belian is mostly a one- or two-trick pony, but she can be very strong when you draft her in RTA against the right team.\nBuild Notes\nThe builds for Belian are surprisingly diverse. There are four builds that are the most common: the Counter build, General Speed Build, Lifesteal build, and Injury build. She;s pretty good on Injury, due to how all of her attacks are AoE and her s1 can proc into another attack at times.\nA good goalpost for Belian stats looks to be about:\n\n20,000 HP\n1,400 DEF\n200 SPD (On the Counter Build or Injury Build, you can get away with about 180 Speed)\n100% Crit Rate\n270%+ Crit Damage (More is better)\n\nBasically, you want her to be tanky enough that she can keep her passive going as long as possible, but still deal enough damage to be an actual threat against the enemies.\n",

This means Arby or any revived DPS won;t be dealing much damage to anyone on your team and no debuffs can be applied. A very useful niche skill but it is powerful in PvP.\nHis skill 3 reduces damage taken when skill is available to use, further improving the survivability of your allies.

It can finish off tanky units when on low health.\nOverall, he is a stellar unit for PvP for both Guild Wars and the Arena. Worth pulling for end game veteran players. It;s recommended to use HP% on all of his right-side gear to beef up his barriers, with 150-170 speed being optimal for him. However, if you can;t get that on him, it;s alright to drop the HP% boots for Speed and find more HP% in the substats.\n",

However, looking at her from a glance, it seems likely that Kanna will solely be a PVE unit, and a mediocre one at best. Her Connection is long and pretty tedious, too. So far, it looks like she;s only good in Earth Expedition and Golem Hunt.\nBuild Notes\nThere;s no perfect one-size-fits-all build for Kanna yet, but she can be built similar to Vildred (aka a Speed-based damage dealer). You;ll want to aim for as much Speed as you can get on her, along with the usual ATK%, Crit DMG%, and Crit Rate. She doesn;t need much Effectiveness built into her, as she doesn;t have any debuffs in her base kit, and her passive boosts her effectiveness when her s3 is available.\n",

      "description": "Note (22/12/2022 Buff): New buff changes her S3 into defense break instead of defense down. Also, her passive now disables revives for allies and enemies.\nML Iseria is a really strong unit, especially for PvP. Her entire kit revolves around dealing with evasion type units such Assassin Cartuja, ML Dreamblade units like Arbiter Vildred, Remnant Violet, Assassin Cidd, Celine etc. Her passive gives her up to 35% bonus hit chance.\nAlongside Oath Key artifact, she will have 65% bonus hit chance (max skill), giving her a huge advantage against high evasion units. Her passive also has a built in bonus attack that works like Reingar;s Special Drink artifact and ignores 70% of the enemy;s defense when it procs. Keep in mind that the artifact also stacks with her passive, making it a no brainer to pair it alongside her passive.\nHer skill 3 strips all enemy buffs and has a high chance to apply both unbuffable and decrease defense debuff. That means she can either be used as a first turn strip unit or a cleave unit with high attack power. Her skill 1 only gives 1 turn defense break, so it is not as reliable as regular Iseria.\nWith that said, she excels in PvP against buff heavy tanky teams. If you have high enough attack (4000+) and crit damage, she can instantly destroy Kayron through his immortality buff.\nKeep in mind that if you build her with a lot of offensive stats, you will need to bring healers to sustain her as she will most likely be fragile. Thankfully, as of her latest buff, she;ll grant Immortality on herself upon taking fatal damage.\n",

You;ll usually want to build your Cecilia as tanky as possible, giving lots of thought into HP% and DEF%. Speed shouldn;t be ignored, though, and you;ll want some Effectiveness to land her debuff.\n",

      "description": "Celestial Mercedes is the better counterpart than the regular free version. She provides AoE attacks as well, but with unhealable on the first skill and a powerful 3rd skill that can let her go twice if she makes a lot of critical hits on more than one enemy. The subsequent attack will hit harder since she gains an attack buff.\nThat is actually very powerful in PvP, particularly in the arena as you can hit 4 enemies. She works very well in a cleave team. She now soul burns on her skill 2 instead of skill 3.\nShe is very slow though, so some speed substats would really help.\nWhen using her with the Azimanik Oneshot build, remember to always pair her with Radiant Forever. Aim for 100% Crit Rate (or as close to 100% as you can), and crank up her Crit Damage to 350%, along with around 4.5k Attack. These are not stats that new players can achieve, though, and as such should not be aimed for unless you;re very late-game.\n",

      "description": "Update (22/12/2022) Buff: Her S3 now ignores damage sharing effects and her S2 passive is unaffected by elemental disadvantage but loses the damage sharing effect.\nCeline is a great offensive and defensive unit that has been given to us by Smilegate. Celine shines in against any team or enemy that uses non attack skill. Her passive cleanses any debuffs and randomly attacks an enemy whenever that happens. That gives her an element of surprise and she can really do some serious damage with good gear.\nHer skill 3 now gains barrier + evasion while slicing her enemy into pieces and recovering health. It ignores damage sharing effects as well. She can soul burn it for even more damage (2.3x multiplier). With an attack buff, she can safely destroy any non fire enemies pretty easily. Her skill 1 also has a damage bonus if she crits. So make sure to get to 100% critical rate if you can.\nOn defense, especially in PvP, she shines the most in Guild Wars as her passive limits enemy attack units due to a 33% chance to get rocked by her attack (especially with her artifact), making it hard to bring someone like Auxiliary Lots or any buffer.\nSince her passive always has elemental advantage, she will always be lethal against fire units.  Overall, she is a strong single target damage dealer that can fit into most team compositions. Having immunity set on her helps in PvP to avoid getting stunned/silenced.\nBuilds Note\nWhen using the builds recommended on this page, it;s good to aim for 4k+ ATK and around 300-350% Crit Damage, along with as high as you can get her Crit Chance. These aren;t stats that can be obtained by newer players, but are the best stats for her in PVP and Guild Wars. You can use either Critical or Immunity for both builds, and can swap her Speed boots for Attack% if you can get enough speed on her. 200-250 is the recommended speed for her.\n",

      "description": "With her being out now, I think Cerise is the perfect end game unit for most players. Her primary role lies in Arena and Guild Wars. She is a utility attacker that focuses on disrupting the enemy over\nLet;s start off with her skill 3. It is an AoE attack that decreases buff duration by 1 turn (hence stripping immunity) and then decreases speed and restrict the unit from any combat readiness manipulation. This is key in dealing with people that have immunity sets on. She then gets invincibility buff, which protects her from damage.\nHer skill 2 can stun an enemy and keep key units from moving. The good thing is that it also increases her own combat readiness by 50%, allowing her to cycle her skills. Her skill 1 also triggers a dual attack from a random ally, which is very strong in PvP, especially guild wars.\nShe already has a high base speed, so she will be able to outspeed most units. She is best used in Arena/Guild Wars against teams that have immunity on turn 1 and also stop key units from moving with speed debuff.\nBuild Note\nTrying to build her as an attacker will not be ideal as her base attack is low and her skill multipliers are not high.\nWhen building Cerise for end-game Arena, you;ll want to aim for 130%+ Effectiveness, and as much Speed as you can get on her. Optimally, her speed should be about 290+, but 300 and above is the most you;d need. These are not stats that can be achieved by newer players, and is for Arena and RTA in late-to-endgame.\nIn the build recommendations, you don;t need Immunity on Cerise if it means you end up sacrificing Speed or Effectiveness. By all means, if you can use Immunity on her and achieve the optimal stats, then you can use it. However, her main priority is being very fast with high Effectiveness. It;s also ideal to try and get some HP% substats on her, however it should not be valued over Speed or Effectiveness.\n",

Her skill set allows her to use her skill 3 twice, which means you can take out even tanky units thanks to the 50% defense penetration.\nHer rotation will be S3 ; S2 ;S3, with the second S3 dealing more damage because of the greater attack buff. Her artifact is perfect for skyrocketing her damage.\nCritical damage, attack and critical rate will be top stats for her to shine. She is easy to build as she barely needs any effectiveness unless you really need her unhealable debuff.\nBuild Notes\nWhen using the typical Full Damage Cermia build, you;ll want to aim for about 5k+ Attack and 350% Crit Damage, along with as much Crit Chance as you can get. Her base speed;s; not the best, so you can aim for about 190 speed. These are not stats that new players can achieve, and the 5k attack may make a few people balk. However, it is possible, as Cermia has an insanely high base attack. If you;re going for a Cermia build with 200+ speed, though, it;s okay to sacrifice some Attack for it. A 200+ speed Cermia can use about 4k attack, still 350% Crit Damage. You won;t be doing that speed most likely, though, as you;d usually pair her with someone like Auxiliary Lots.\nSurprisingly, people do build Cermia as a bruiser, but it;s pretty uncommon; don;t knock it until you try it. When building her as a bruiser, aim for about 14k HP and 1200 defense, along with having an insane amount of support. Her damage stats should be at 3.8k attack and 260% Crit Damage. This takes a lot of really good gear to achieve, mind you, and it can be easier to straight-up build the raw damage Cermia. However, her multipliers are very good, so she still could do some decent damage with the bruiser build.\n",

That means he will heal and counter attack 2 enemies every time he gets debuffed.\nWith the A11 Queen bleeding you constantly, ML Zerato gets to counter attack while hitting one of the eggs. Very effective I would say. You do need a lifesteal set to make it happen though. The extra healing keeps him alive.\nAs for PvP, he now directly counters Dizzy or any heavy debuffer, so he does have a role there now. All in all, he is a solid pick since he also provides defense break and attack down in his kit. Update: As of August 2020, the fact he transfers debuffs no longer ignores effect resistance of his enemies. This makes him a little less useful, but he;s still pretty good.\nBuild Notes\nWhen you;re going to build him in PVE, you can make him as squishy as you like, and focus solely on his damage. However, in PVP, you do want him a bit bulky so he can take a hit or two. When building him for PVE, you;ll want to aim for about:\n\n 3.5k+ ATK\n250%+ Crit Damage\n70-120% Effectiveness\n100% Crit Rate\n170-ish speed\n\nWhen you;re using the Lifesteal build, make sure to use the Lifesteal pieces that the lower floors of Abyss give you. He;s a good contender for those pieces (not to mention that below floor 100, there is yet another set of Lifesteal gear available).\nIn PVP, you want about the same thing, with the addition of:\n\n1.2k-1.4k-ish Defense\n14k+ HP\n\nAs you can see, a PVP Champion Zerato is very stat-hungry. He;s also one of the few units that would actually suffer with Immunity on him, as he wouldn;t be able to counterattack and throw the enemy;s debuffs back at them. You can build him very bulky and sacrifice damage stats, however this would (of course) lead to less damage. Doing this means you;d need Fairy Tale for a Nightmare on him.\nNote: You can use an Effectiveness ring on Champion Zerato, but doing so would end up sacrificing a lot of damage or bulkiness.\n",

He can be built offensively or defensively, depending on your preferences and the needs of your team. In PvP, he excels in both offense and defense, especially if you run Elbris Ritual Sword on him. He can proc his S1 into S2 against buffed enemies, and it;s insane to watch.\nBuild Notes\nThere are 2 ways you can build Charles: The Full-Counter Build and the regular Damage Build, which can work with Counter or Speed, it;s not just the Speed that;s recommended in the build. For the Full Counter Build, the stats you;d want to achieve are:\n\n14k+ HP%\n1300 Defense%\n3000+ ATK (You can keep it at around 2700+ ATK if he;s tankier)\n270%+ Crit Damage (You can stay at 260%+ Crit Damage with a tankier build)\n150+ Speed\n\nThe regular Damage build requires the same stats, however you will need 200+ Speed in order for him to work. When doing the Full Counter Build, you can use either HP% or ATK% for his ring or boots, so he has some survivability. It entirely depends on what you can achieve with what gear.\n",

      "description": "Charlotte gets a complete rework and now utilizes Fighting spirit, much similar to Ravi and Ken. Her ratings will be subject to change upon some testing.\nNow she actually becomes stronger every time she gets hit. She gains attack and defense buff for 1 turn after that via her skill 2 passive. On top of that, she also gains combat readiness as well. That means she will be beefy enough to take some hits before going down.\nHer skill 1 also turns into AoE when she is buffed. Now she is going to fit really well into teams both PvE and PvP.\nHer skill 3 can;t be used right at the start, but she can gain fighting spirit easily and you can soul burn it to use it over and over again. Now, 100% crit rate is not required as skill 3 always is a critical hit as long it doesn;t miss.\nBuild Notes\nCharlotte is one of the few units who doesn;t need Crit Rate, so you can load up as much Crit Damage as you need to. However, she is still a Knight, and needs to be relatively tanky if she wants to soak up enough hits to activate her s3. When building your Charlotte, you;ll have two ways to go: slow or fast. With a slow Charlotte, the stats you;ll be aiming for are about:\n\n17k HP\n3.5k ATK\n1.2k DEF\n150+ speed\nAs much Crit Damage as possible\n\nWith a fast Charlotte, these stats are about the same, with the exception of:\n\n190-200 Speed\n1.3k DEF\n14k HP\n\nUsing the Damage Build in the Recommended Sets section eliminates the need to use Speed boots on her, if you can get her to 150~ speed which just substats alone (which is completely achievable if you;ve been farming the Hunts). However, using the Fast Charlotte Build still requires Speed boots, otherwise you;ll end up getting lapped, and she;ll just straight-up never get a turn.\nOverall, the Damage Build requires less gear requirements, but the fast build will have better results.\n",

      "description": "Chloe is a great single target attacker with a unique debuff called magic nail, which deals a percentage damage of the enemies health. Her 3rd skill does bonus damage when magic nail is applied.\nShe is a hard hitter, especially when the enemy is debuffed with defense down, magic nail and Chloe has attack buff. Build her with critical damage and crit rate to see some amazing numbers.\nShe is very useful in Wyvern and Banshee hunts, Raid bosses and certain Abyss floors where DPS is required. Just make sure to get an attack buffer and defense breaker in your team.\nShe has low defense, but it is a good tradeoff for insane damage.\nWith the new exclusive equipment update, she can now also apply defense break if you get the skill upgrade, which is pretty nice.\nBuild Notes\nSince you;re most likely going to be using her as a massive Wyvern 13 damage dealer, you;ll want to use the Destruction build for her maximum potential. The stats to aim for are around:\n\n3500+ ATK\n50%+ Crit Rate\n300%+ Crit Damage\n197~ Speed\n\nYou don;t have to worry about speed at all if you have General Purrgis, however 197 speed is enough for her to get 4 turns before the Wyvern places his barrier. You;ll only need about 50% Crit Rate because of Furious;s Crit Rate buff. Usually, when using Chloe as a W13 damage dealer, you;ll want her to go last, so that the rest of your team can set her up to chain her S2 into her S3. As such, you;ll have to speed tune your team to make sure that Chloe always goes last.\nIf you do have a General Purrgis, you can drop having Speed boots in the Wyvern Damage Dealer build, and instead give her ATK% boots. Otherwise, keep the SPD on.\nAlways use Daydream Joker on Chloe when using her in Wyvern. Her own artifact, A Little Queen;s Huge Crown, is situational at best for her, and relies on the Wyvern having his barrier up for her to do more damage. Using A Little Queen;s Huge Crown is not recommended.\nWhen using her for Wyvern, you;ll want to use either her Extra Turn EE or her Defense Break EE, depending on if your team can get in enough debuffs so the Wyvern doesn;t choose to hit anyone except your tank.\nIt is possible to use her in PVP, but not a lot of people do, especially in late-game. That;s where you;d use Creation and Destruction + the Fast PVP build. The stats to aim for when using her in PVP are:\n\n4000+ ATK\nAs much Crit Rate as possible\n200+ Speed\n300%+ Crit Damage\nExtra Turn Exclusive Equipment\n\nThese aren;t stats that any new player can achieve, and Chloe is a very niche pick in PVP. Overall, it;d be best to save her for PVE content; however, if you really like her enough to use in PVP, that;s how you;d want to build her.\n[2/17/2022 Update] ; Her passive now gets +50% combat readiness. Her S3 cooldown is reduced by 1 but deals a bit less damage.\n",

      "description": "[09/06/2022] Update: Skill 1 now gets an extra turn when soul burned.\nWith the new changes, she now can activate skill 1 into skill 2 sometimes, similar to how Charles does it. She is basically the ice version of him, except that she scales of health instead of attack. However, she needs to use her skill 3 for the counterattack chance to be present. A counterattack set would work well here. Since her skill 2 penetrates defense, she can hit pretty hard if geared well.\nSince her skill 3 gives defense buff and crit chance resist, she is naturally tanky and can protect her allies as well. As long as she can survive, she will be counter attacking as long as the enemy has a lot of AoE attacks. However, her activation chance is still a bit RNG and sometimes may not go in your favor. Keep that in mind.\nBuild Notes\nYou;d want to build Choux similarly to Alencia. She;s a bruiser-type unit, and her damage scales off of her Max Health. A Counter build is considered to be one of the best builds for her, as it;ll stack up more Focus for her second skill. Of course, putting a Counter unit on Immunity is absolutely necessary, so don;t skimp out on it.\nIt is also possible to put Choux on Lifesteal, but Counter is considered to be the best 4-set build for her to use.\nWhen building your Choux, these are about the stats that you;d want to aim for:\n\n20k HP\n1.4k DEF\n160+ Speed\nAs much Crit Rate as possible\n260%+ Crit Damage\n\nEffectiveness is unneeded on her, as she has no debuffs to plant on the enemy.\nGenerally speaking, Draco Plate and Snow Crystal are the best artifacts to use on her. Snow Crystal synergizes very well with her anti-crit, and increases her Combat Readiness should she be hit with a non-critical hit. Draco Plate, in general, is just a very good Artifact that almost any Warrior-type unit can use. However, if you find that you;re not able to achieve the Crit Rate you want, you can put Alencinox;s Wrath on her. Any fight she;s in will end up dragging for pretty long, so it;s possible to stack up enough Crit Rate to put her at a full 100% in the battle.\n",

      "description": "(Written 5/21/21)\nThe Church of Ilryos Axe (and, by extent, his specialty changed version, Chaos Sect Axe) once absolutely dominated the meta. However, these days, he;s fallen out of use, as he;s replaced by better units, such as Blood Blade Karin. His Specialty Change grind is also very long, and isn;t really worth it in the end. This is especially after his balance changes, which removes a lot of the damage that he does, and makes him another ;if the enemy is XYZ element; unit after post-SC.\nThe builds on this page are considered to be laying down the foundation for his Specialty Changed version, Chaos Sect Axe, and don;t change much between pre- and post-SC.\nBuild Notes\nYou;d start building the Ilryos Axe the same way you;d build Chaos Sect Axe, in that there;s no final row of stats to aim for. Overall, you;d just want to go for as much ATK%, CRIT Rate% and CRIT DMG% as you can get. After that, you can prioritize his HP% and DEF% for some bulk, so that he;s not instantly taken out in one hit.\nWhen using his builds, you can use Speed boots on him if you want him to be self-reliant and not need other units to set him up. Otherwise, keeping the ATK% boots would work alright on him.\nOnce again, it;s not recommended to build him as a new player. He;s very stat hungry, and is considered to be more along the lines of a generic DPS (Damage Per Second) unit that specializes in nowhere.\n",

      "description": "Cidd is a very, very, very good one-shot unit. He;s actually considered to be one of the top-tier 4-star units in the game, because of his damage potential. He can actually work as an early-game farmer should you not have someone like Lena, but his potential shines in Banshee Hunts and PVP ; specifically, in Arena Offense and Guild Wars.\nFor best results when using him in PVP, Cidd needs to be paired up with units like Yuna or Sinful Angelica. They;ll have to go first, plant Speed Increase and Attack Buff on Cidd, and then he can trigger his s3 for maximum damage. If you use him with Sinful Angelica, it;s very much possible for him to kill off units like Arbiter Vildred before attacking somebody else.\nBuild Notes\nIt was mentioned in the cons that Cidd is very stat-hungry, and it;s true. In general, Speed-based nukers are difficult to build, because they require so much in stats. In general, it;s best to crank as much ATK%, Crit Rate%, Crit DMG%, and (of course) Speed into Cidd as you can. The end-game stats that you;d want to aim for Cidd are:\n\n3000+ ATK\n230+ Speed\nAt least 90% Crit Rate (100% is optimal)\nAs much Crit DMG as possible (aim for about 300%+)\n\nThese stats also work when you;re using him for the Banshee Build. Just remember to pair that build with Daydream Joker, for extra damage.\nGenerally, when using him with a Speed + ATK buffer in PVP, you;ll need to speed tune your buffer so that they;re 11 speed faster than Cidd. This is to guarantee that they;ll always get the first turn and that RNG doesn;t screw you over. Make sure not to have too big of a gap between your buffer and Cidd, so that the enemy can;t cut in between them.\nIt should be noted that Cidd can;t oneshot Banshee ; to do so, you;d need absolutely insane stats on him (as in, physically can;t be achieved). If you were planning on using Cidd to oneshot Banshee 13, that will not be possible. However, he does make for a very good Banshee damage dealer in general.\n",

      "description": "Clarissa is a great farmer with an AoE reset. She also brings defense break on her 1st skill and bleeding + defense break on her 3rd skill. When she kills an enemy with skill 1 and 3, she gets enraged buff and gains 10% bonus speed and attack. Her rage cannot be dispelled now!\nFor PvE, she is useful in Abyss and Raid where AoE is required. She is very useful and often overlooked by some players. She is also a viable Wyvern 13 team member, as a backup Defense Breaker or extra damage. She can also be used as a backup debuffer, because her Bleeds can be stacked as extra debuffs. With her Bleed EE, this makes her even more viable as someone to put on W13.\nFor PvP, she can capitalise on her passive if you can get her to kill at least one enemy. This can be risky as it is more of an all in strategy and can backfire if you fail to kill an enemy, especially in a squishy speed team that relies on damage and have little survivability. These days, almost no one uses Clarissa in PVP, though, as there are infinitely better options (not to mention that cleansing and debuff immunity has become the new meta).\nBuild Notes\nYou;re primarily going to be using her in Wyvern 13, as a backup damage dealer or debuffer. She;s not a must-have unit who can replace anyone (certainly not Furious), however she can work. Which build you use in the Recommended Sets section depends on what niche you want her to fill. However, the stats you should usually go for are:\n\n3000+ ATK\n65% Effectiveness\n85% Crit Rate (only 50% needed with Furious)\n300%+ Crit Damage\n170+ Speed\n\nYou;ll always want to pair her with her Bleed Exclusive Equipment when using her in Wyvern. Even though the Bleed doesn;t ignore Effect Resistance, it;s still a 100% chance to land it unless resisted, and it;s on her first skill.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 4/13/22): His skill 3 now cannot be counterattacked.\nIt;s been about two weeks since Closer Charles has released, and the consensus is out: his s3 animation is pretty sloppily done, but his skillset by itself is decent. He;s cemented a decent spot in cleave teams, which seems to be getting more and more counters with each new unit. C.Charles isn;t going to be an utter game-breaker such as, say, Rem; however he can be an opener or a turn-2 unit, meaning he;d need some other unit to be an opener.\nLike Violet, he can trigger Perception on himself, and also does good things with said Perception. He can also decrease the cooldown of his s3 via killing with his s1 while he has perception, but that is a bit of a difficult condition to trigger.\nIn short, Closer Charles is made for cleaving in late-game Arena, and as such this build page will treat his optimal build as if you have very late-game gear. These stats are not going to be immediately achievable for a new player.\nBuild Notes\nThere;s two real ways you can build Closer Charles, and the difference between them is just a matter of his Speed (and maybe his ATK to a lesser extent). The General Speed Build is the best way to go, with a focus on Crit Rate%, Crit DMG%, ATK% and Speed as the substats to look for. Seeing as he doesn;t have any debuffs to worry about, Effectiveness isn;t necessary, and Resistance would just be kind of wasted, considering the Evasion in his kit.\nIf you;re going for making Closer Charles a turn 1 opener, the stats to look for is about:\n\n280+ Speed\n3,000~ ATK\n85% Crit Rate (although 100% is optimal)\n250% Crit DMG\n\nFor Closer Charles being a second turn cleaver, his stats will be:\n\n3,500+ ATK\n200 Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n280%+ Crit DMG (300% is optimal)\n\n",

      "description": "Update (14/4/2022): With her new skill set, she is quite useful in dealing with fire units, especially Hwayoung. Her S3 now reduce buff duration by 1 and applies a bleed and bomb stack. She gains 100% CR if it is on fire units, allowing her to instantly use her S2 follow up and detonate the bomb and bleeds.\nHer S1 steals a buff and when soul burned, it steals up to two buffs. With this new skillset, she no longer needs to be on a crit damage build to be effective. A high attack, high speed and decent effectiveness is a more recommended build.\nStats should be something like:\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n220+ Speed\n50%+ Effectiveness (optional but useful against other elements)\n\nThe more speed the better if you want to make sure you are going ahead of any fire unit. Also, any fire elemental based missions or events is her time to shine.\nBuild Notes (Old Kit)\nIt;s best to note that Scorpio Thieves (the star sign and class that Coli is) has some of the worst stats. Like Celine, Baiken and almost every other Scorpio Thief in the game, Coli suffers from a very low base defense. However, she also has average HP, mediocre ATK, and her speed isn;t the best for a Thief. As such, Coli is very hard to build, and there;s no place where she shines in. You;d be better off building a multitude of any other units in place of her.\nHowever, if Coli is your favorite character, you;re at late-game, need a World Boss Unit, have gear to burn, or anything else, then you could build her if you really wanted to. It;s not very recommended, but whatever floats your boat. If you decide to build Coli, you;d want to aim for about:\n\n2.5k ATK\n200+ SPD\n90%+ Crit Rate (100% is optimal)\n250%+ Crit Damage\n\nThere;s no artifact that immediately works best for her. Usually, most people put her on Dust Devil, because when she procs Dust Devil while she has Stealth, she;ll attack 4 times in total. However, remember that the chance is only 30.0% when fully Limit Broken. There;s a few other Artifacts recommended in her build page, but once again, there;s no one-size-fits-all artifact for Coli.

It;s not like a player can throw her into whatever team in any area and instantly win the game with her. Although Laika does need a team built around her, she can shine pretty well once she;s all set up properly.\nHer s3 doesn;t have much to offer; Sleep is a debuff that that many PvE bosses are immune to, though the AoE immunity on her team can be nice. However, her real flagship skill is her s2; not only does she plant Target on an enemy for 2 turns, but she;ll also increase the ATK of her ally with the highest Attack for 2 turns, decrease skill cooldown by a turn, and then trigger a Dual Attack with them. This is an insanely loaded skill, especially for an s2 of all things; most players would expect something like this from an s3.\nEven though her s2 is this loaded, she actually isn;t used that much in PvP. There have been a lot of PvE teams that feature Laika, thanks to how well she can enable her high-damage allies. There are teams for her in Caides and a few other Expedition elements; she can;t carry a team singlehandedly, but she still makes for a good supporting unit!\nBuild Notes\nA player wants to build Laika with a high amount of Speed, HP% and Effectiveness%. You also want to ensure that she also has a decent amount of DEF% as well, but it;s not a must-have for Laika. She, of course, needs to have Speed as her main four-set. However, her two-set can be either Hit or Immunity.\nYour ideal Command Model Laika stats should look something like:\n\n270+ Speed (More is better)\n12,000 HP\n1,000~ DEF\n80%+ Effectiveness (More is always better)\n\n",

      "description": "Commander Lorina, alongside Falconer Kluri is a great addition to your team as a single target DPS. She can be used in pretty much all content and does her job well enough to warrant a spot in your team. Due to her elemental being neutral, you don;t have to worry about missing and is a great all round attacker for all PvE content.\nShe gets stronger as the battle goes on with her passive attack boost. She can reduce enemy combat readiness with her ult and do good damage. Also in certain Abyss floors, you will need to bring no debuff DPS (Specter Tenebria in Floor 90 is the first that comes to mind), which she can fill that role. Her skill tree also improves her dual attack chance.\nInvesting in her is a good choice if you don;t have a good single target DPS. Even though she;s outshined by Landy and Free Spirit Tieria, her specialty tree makes her better than F.S. Tieria (though F.S. Tieria and Lena are still better at farming than she is). She;s an absolute monster in PVE content, and you can use her almost everywhere except Wyvern.\nIt;s best to note that she;s not the best in PVP, as it;ll take her 5 turns to build up to her full potential.\nBuild Notes\nC.Lorina is pretty versatile and easy to build, as you can use the free Attack Set that the Adventurer;s Path gives you. However, Destruction does scale better with her passive, since Attack buffs would end up doing less for her than it would for usual units. Lifesteal can work (especially the Lifesteal gear from Abyss), but Attack or Destruction would be better ways to go.\nWhen building C.Lorina, you just want to get her stats as high as possible (as she;s solely a PVE unit). However, it;s best to aim your final Commander Lorina stat goals to be something along the lines of:\n\n3k-4k ATK\n90%+ Crit Chance (100% is optimal)\n250-300% Crit Damage\n160+ Speed\n\nBuild Note: If you can achieve 160 speed with just substats, then you can leave her on ATK% boots, as stated in her Recommended Sets. However, if you see that you can;t, it;s okay to swap her ATK% boots out for Speed main-stat. You do want to have some speed on C.Lorina, even if you have Hell Cutter on her, so she can actually get a turn.\nIt;s also a good idea to stack some HP on Commander Lorina, so she doesn;t immediately die if the enemies even breathe on her funny. About 7k-8k HP should do the trick. HP isn;t a priority on her, though, and other damage-based stats shouldn;t be sacrificed for HP.\n",

      "description": "(Written 7-20-22)\nConqueror Lilias is an insanely good unit; a lot of players agree that she has a very overloaded kit that can work in just about any team. While C.Lilias is not, say, a unit that can singlehandedly solo everyone in the enemy team, the amount of buffs and debuffs that she provides is more than enough to enable her own team to unlock their full potential.\nAs her s3 provides AoE Vigor to everyone on her team (the undispellable debuff that increases the wearer;s Attack and Defense by 30%), decreases enemy buff durations, and decreases their attack for 2 turns before granting her a second turn, Conqueror Lilias can make for a great opening unit. On top of this, with her extra turn on her s3, she can chain that into her S2, which decreases a chosen enemy;s Combat Readiness by 25%, before inflicting Redirected Provoke for a turn, before granting herself and the tankiest ally in her team a barrier for 2 turns. Her S1 isn;t anything to write home about, as it;s pretty much the exact same as her RGB variant. She will attack an enemy with her sword, before pulling along a random ally with her for a Dual Attack.\nC.Lilias is not exactly a PvE unit ; players wouldn;t want to put her in a Wyvern 13 team and expect success, for example. However, where she shines is in anything PvP related. She makes for a great opener in Guild War Offense, Arena Offense, and ; of course ; RTA. In fact, she has a very high first-pick rate in RTA, and it;s rare that she can make it past the banning stage. Even barring the units that directly benefit from Vigor (Inferno Khawazu is the first that comes to mind), nearly every damage dealer or tanky unit will love having C.Lilias on their team.\nBuild Notes\nC.Lilias is one of those units that is very hard to build. This is not because she requires a weird myriad of stats, but because a player will want to stack her Speed and other stats as high as possible, to the point that the goalpost for the ;ideal Conqueror Lilias build; is so high it;s pretty much unattainable for newer players.\nShe needs to have Speed as her four-set gear. While this page uses Immunity as her choice of two-set gear, pretty much anything can work on her, as she is one of those units that relies more on stats than sets for the two-set gear. C.Lilias can work on a broken set, as long as it gets her stats to where they have to be.\nAn ideal Conqueror Lilias looks to be something like:\n\n290+ Speed (300+ is ideal; openers always want to go first)\n20,000+ HP\n1,400+ Defense\n60%+ Effectiveness (100% Effectiveness and more would be ideal)\n\nOf course, more Speed will always be ideal. If a player has to choose between adding more Speed or adding any other stat, it would be best to go for Speed.\n",

      "description": "The post nerf Corvus can no longer solo 1v3 many top ML units due to the new changes. He loses his defense buff from S3 and also now need 100 fighting spirit to activate his S3. That means it takes a bit longer to amp up the healing and he is unable to keep on using S3 over and over again when he is getting hit.\nIn other words, you really shouldn;t build Corvus.\nBuild Notes\nBuilding Corvus is; not the best of ideas. Seriously, after his nerf, he;s bad. As in, it;s genuinely recommended to not build him at all. There are infinitely better units that you can use in place of him. If, for some reason, you want to build him (which is once again not recommended in general, new player or veteran), though, then you can build him with either the Counter Set or the Speed Set.\nCounter works on Corvus, as his s1 transfers debuffs, gains Fighting Spirit, and stuns if he used his S3. Speed is just a safe bet to use on pretty much anyone. Immunity is a must-have when building Corvus on Counter, so he doesn;t get immediately shut down. Generally, it;s a good idea to make sure that you always use Immunity when building units on Counter, for exactly that reason.\nWhen building your Corvus (which, again, not recommended), you;d want to aim for about:\n\n17,000 HP\nAt least 2,000 DEF\n200%+ Resistance\n150+ Speed\n\nNote: In either of the Recommended builds, you can use either DEF% or HP% for the ring/boots. However, if you switch out his SPD boots for DEF% or HP%, you will lose a lot of speed, and then either Durandal or El;s Fist will end up becoming necessary.\n",

      "description": "Due to his slow speed, he is often overlooked. With the emergence of Wyvern 11-13, he is now usable as a beefy frontline tank or sideline tank with Aurius to absorb damage. His attack down also helps with reducing damage taken from the Wyvern. He can also be used in high-level PVP with Tempest Surin, but it;s best to note that this is very late-game. This shouldn;t be worried about if you;re just now getting to W13. His 8 and 8.5 rating for Arena and Guild Wars is because of that late-game potential.\nIt;s good to note that, because he has Attack Break on his s1, he;s a prime candidate for a Wyvern tank. Remember that W13 needs at least 2 debuffs in order to hit your frontline tank.\nBuild Notes\nWhen building your Crozet, you;ll want to stack as much HP and DEF on him as you can if you;re using him as a W13 tank.

      "description": "Update: S3 now also applies extinction and he is immune to stun!\nDark Corvus is a tanky warrior that can use a strong single target attack that penetrate defense after some turns have passed depending on how many times he gets hit. This is very good against squishy teams that don;t do enough damage to kill him.\nHe works very well in PvP, particularly in defense teams with healers and tanks. Also in Guild Wars, he has kill potential in defense as well.\nDue to his slow way of killing things, he isn;t a very popular character among newer players, but for veterans and higher level players in PvP, they do know that he is good in long battles. He scales very well with his HP.\nBuild Notes\nWhen building Dark Corvus, you usually want to crank up your stats in HP%, Speed, and Effect Resistance.

      "description": "Note 09/06/2022: Change in kit. With the new changes, he is able to destroy barrier units, especially if they have a thick barrier. His skill 2 does damage based off how much hp the barrier protects, thus punishing barrier reliant units like Peira, Fallen Cecilia and Blood Moon Haste for example. His PvE utility is still not great, but he does shine in PvP now.\nBuild Notes\nIt;s not really recommended to build him right now because of the state he;s in, however he does okay in RTA, and some have build him for that. Desert Jewel Basar is considered to be a ;one-trick pony,; and his entire gimmick is resisting and healing. As such, you;ll want to make sure that you have enough Effect Resistance and Speed on him. Even ATK is considered a wasted stat on him, because his healing will just always be bad, no matter how much you crank up his ATK.\nThe stats to aim for are about:\n\n250%+ Effect Resistance\nAt least 12,000 HP\n220+ Speed\n1,500 Defense\n\nNote: You can swap out the HP% necklace for Def% in either builds if you need it, but note that means it;ll be harder to get the ideal HP% needed.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 4/8/21)\nDesigner Lilibet is an interesting unit. She;s a Defense-based unit, and her s1 and s3 scale off of her Defense. As such, she;ll need to be built as a typical bruiser. Though her S3 isn;t a full buff dispel, it can work in a pinch for debuff-heavy comps, such as against Fairytale Tenebria or Cerise. Her s2 can cycle pretty quickly, as well. The skill cooldown increase can also help in PVP as well.\nShe;s a unit that shines her brightest in PVP ; in other words, Guild Wars, Arena, and the Real Time Arena. In PVE, you;d be better off just bringing an actual cleanser (e.g. Achates, Angelic Montmorancy, etc.), because ML Lilibet;s s3 debuff decrease is; situational, and silence can;t be applied on PVE bosses.\nIn other words, Designer Lilibet is a late-game PVP unit, and new players shouldn;t focus on building her yet.\nBuild Notes\nWhen building Designer Lilibet, you can either use the Fast Build, Immunity Build, or Counter Build. However, Immunity isn;t a must-have on her, as she constantly cleanses herself with her passive. Really, putting Immunity on her is to keep her from getting her Combat Readiness decreased or as an anti-Seal mechanism.\nIn other words, Immunity is optional at best for her, but it won;t actively harm her skillset, like Immunity would for Champion Zerato. However, when using the Counter Build, Immunity is necessary. Counter must almost always be paired with Immunity.\nWhen building her, the stats you would want to aim for her are about:\n\n12k-13k+ HP\nAs much Defense as possible (1.8k+ is a good start, but 2k+ DEF is optimal)\n170-180 speed\n90%+ Crit Rate (100% is optimal)\nAt least 250% Crit Damage\n\nPutting ATK on her is not necessary, as her ATK multipliers are very bad, and her DEF multipliers scale much better for damage. You can also put Designer Lilibet on 200+ speed if you wanted, but it;s not necessary, and 180 would work just fine if needed.\nNote: On any of the 3 mentioned in the Recommended Sets, you can skip SPD boots for DEF% for extra damage, if you can achieve 180+ with just substats. However, that would require much higher quality gear, and isn;t recommended.\n[2/17/2022 Update] ; She now gets defense buff for 1 turn on her passive and her S3 now gets 15% combat readiness push for allies (excluding herself).\n",

      "description": "Destina gets revive after the buff on 14/4/2022.\nWith the new skill set, she loses some CR pushing mechanics from her S3 and gains a 20% revive of all allies. Her new skill set compliments a bruiser or tanky team. Since the revive doesn;t have any sort of damage mitigation, it works best on bruisers and tanks since they are more likely to survive after getting revived.\nHer special effect gives 2 turns of 60% effect resist, which is great since it will pretty much allow her to avoid getting debuffed so she can heal and push her ally if needed. Keep in mind that she can still be stunned or debuffed by things that ignore effect resistance (abyssal crown, chains of chiron etc.).\nHer S2 is a CR push that heals a decent amount. Her S1 has been changed to heal targets off her own max health. She is in a much better place now. She is useful across all game modes and can aid her allies by cleansing and healing, especially on high health or high defense type units.\nBuild Notes\nYou can go for either the General Speed Build or the Counter Build. The Counter Build is a pretty big risk and requires really good gear, but it can pay off pretty well. You;ll want to make sure she has as much Speed, HP, DEF%, and Resistance that you can get. Something to aim for is about:\n\n135-190 Speed\n17,000+ HP\n1,400+ Defense\n200%+ Resistance\n\nNote: In either of the builds, you can swap out the HP% necklace for DEF% if you like.

Her 3rd skill give 50% combat readiness and if she is fast enough, she can cast 2nd skill barrier almost back to back + cleanse 2 debuffs.\nThis makes her versatile in doing pretty much everything in the game. She is viable almost everywhere. Put that with Celestine or Rod of Amaryllis and she can be a part time support healer as well.\nOh, she is also a great camper in Raid, giving bonus points in most team compositions.\nBuild Notes\nDiene actually can be used with a Counter Build, as she gives herself an insane amount of CR push, especially when buffed. However, the gear requirement is pretty hard to pull off. If you don;t have the requirements, you can instead go with the General Speed Build.

He is still a bit undervalued and can be useful with his S3 bring so much utility. However, there are some downsides to him ; his ATK stat is pretty low, his AI spams his s3/s2 at the beginning of the battle when it;s unnecessary, and his Bleed chance on his s1 is pretty low, even skilled up.

      "description": "Note: Limited Collab \nDizzy is a very versatile AoE mage with strong crowd control. She can stun on skill 1, extend debuffs by 1 turn on skill 2 and decrease enemy combat readiness by 50%! Her skill 3 applies anti damage dealer debuffs (Speed + Attack down and Decrease Hit Chance). So she can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nThe best part is that her skill 3 will miss but debuffs will still land! That makes her a great counter to any evasion type enemies like Assassin Cartuja, Violet and Mirsa.\nFor PvE content, she shines in various Abyss floors with her S3 debuffs, making strong enemies slow and hit for way less damage. She can also do Banshee quite well, especially in the minion phase with her AoE attacks.\nIn PvP, she can be used as a speedy offensive utility or DPS mage by bringing Tagehel;s. She can then burn S3 into S2 for debuffs and -50% enemy team combat readiness. Other good artifacts such as Etica;s Scepter or lela Violin for strip are also possible options. However, these days she;s not as seen in PVP as she used to be, due to the meta shifting towards cleansing and Immunity more than anything else.\nBuild Notes\nFirst of all, you;ll want to get as much Effectiveness% and Speed as possible into her, especially if you;re running her in the Abyss. A good Dizzy build usually sees something along the lines of:\n\n200+ Speed\nAt least 150% Effectiveness (200%+ is optimal)\n16,000 HP\n1,600 Defense\n\nDizzy is pretty stat-hungry, and it;s even harder to achieve the stats with the Counter-Immunity build. Her own artifact, Necro ; Undine, isn;t the best for Dizzy, even though it increases her Combat Readiness, and there are a ton of other Mage artifacts that are good on her.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/9/21)\nDue to Dominiel;s turning her s2 into a randomized passive, she;s fallen even more out of use. She only has a 35% chance to activate what was originally her s2, vs. before, when she could use it whenever it was available for use.\nOvershadowed by her Moonlight counter part, Dominiel does not see much use due to her being more of a PvP focused character. Her stun on skill 3 is lack luster and her skill 2 barrier isn;t as useful for an offensive cleave composition due to Diene being the top performer in this area.\nShe also isn;t good for Wyvern (immune to stun) and that further pushes her down the pecking order for DPS. Basically, Dominiel is; a pretty niche unit. It;s not really recommended to build her (especially if you;re a newer-game player) unless you;re really determined to do so.\nBuild Notes\nFor those lads who are just that determined to build Dominiel because they believe in her, you;ll usually want to build her with the Fast Reflect build or the General Speed Build. The five substats you want to prioritize are her SPD, Effectiveness%, ATK% (for more Barrier strength) and Effect Resistance%.\nThe build that you want to achieve is about:\n\n15,000 HP\n1,500+ ATK\n1,400~ Defense\n200 Speed\n200%+ Effectiveness\n\nYou;ll also want some Effect Resistance, so she doesn;t get debuffed to oblivion and back.\n",

      "description": "Doris;s kit specializes in making your team take reduced damage from the enemy. She is also a rare healer with team defense buff. She is great in PvE content, with Abyss and Raid being the best place for her to shine.\nShe can operate as the frontline tank or support healer, depending on the content. Her second skill is great for long battles and can sustain your team in longer fights. Her third skill also heals one target + some combat readiness.\nShe has a long cooldown on her 2nd skill. Her base speed is also terrible, so you will definitely want speed boots in late game. Once she gets Specialty Changed, she;ll end up becoming a power-house and a great bait against dark units in RTA.\nBuild Notes\nThis page will be used as the foundations for when you Specialty Change Doris into Magic Scholar Doris, and will be treated as such. In that case, you;ll want to make sure she;s on a Speed set. It;s absolutely necessary for her skillset, due to her having a low base Speed (which, granted, does become a little higher when she;s Specialty-Changed, but still).\nThere are 2 ways to go ; the high Resistance build, or the Immunity build. Now, for both builds, you;ll still want to make sure that she has some Effect Resistance on her, because you don;t want her to be debuffed. You can skimp a little on her ER on the Immunity build, but it;s still recommended to get her at least 150% Resistance. 200% is optimal.\nThe final build to aim for is:\n\n17,000-20,000 HP\n1,800 DEF\n190+ Speed\nAt minimum 150% Resistance (200% recommended)\n\nNote: In either build, you can use either DEF% or HP% for the Necklace, and the Ring can be Effect Resistance%, DEF%, or HP%. Do note that a non-ER ring will make it harder to achieve the ER stat, though. Doris can also work with just about any Soul Weaver artifact, not just the ones listed here.\n",

      "description": "Eaton is a great Guild Wars and Arena unit due to his 75% taunt and damage reduction for an ally. You will want high health and on a counter set to make him extremely annoying to fight against.\nOn a counter set, you will mitigate his low speed disadvantage and be able to taunt enemies often. He needs to be paired with a healer and a DPS to make a viable Guild Wars team on offense that is safe to use against dark units.\nThese days, though, Eaton doesn;t see a lot of use anywhere. He;s just a general raw tank in PVE (there;s no one place he shines in, including the Hunts), and in PVP he;s niche and mostly outshined by Troublemaker Crozet now.\nBuild Notes\nIt;s incredibly easy to get HP into Eaton. Since he already has very high base HP, all you have to do is focus on 3 substats ; HP%, DEF%, and Resistance%. You don;t even really need Speed or Resistance on him, but it is still nice to have. The stats to aim for is about:\n\nAt least 30,000 HP (35,000+ optimal)\n1,400 Defense\n120~ Speed\nAny Resistance% okay\n\nAs stated, Eaton is very easy to build, since you;d have to only worry about his HP for the most part.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 11/11/21)\nWith Eda;s new buffs, she;s found herself in a really good spot! She;s not reliant on making Critical Hits anymore, her debuff arsenal is surprisingly good, her s2 now removes two buffs, and so on and so forth. One of the best parts of her kit now is that whenever her s3 is available, she;ll increase her own Combat Readiness by 20% whenever an ally uses a non-attacking skill. That means Ran can use his s2, which would proc Summertime Iseria;s passive, and both of them would increase Eda;s Combat Readiness.\nEda;s pretty versatile with her new buffs; she can be a damage dealer, or a tanky, high-Effectiveness debuffer. Her s2, Cold Snap, dispels two buffs now (not just one), and decreases the Combat Readiness of the enemy team, before giving herself Skill Nullifier. Although her Combat Readiness decrease on her s2 is a bit randomized (decreases a random amount between 15% and 40%), this can actually work in your favor ; it;ll mess up the enemy team;s turn order. On top of that, she can Soulburn her s2 to give her an extra turn, meaning she can go from her S2 to her S3 just like that!\nBuild Notes\nNow that Eda no longer relies on making Critical Hits in order to increase Combat Readiness, her Crit Rate isn;t as necessary as before. Of course, if you;re making a DPS build, you still want to have her at 100% Crit Rate. Very few people have built Eda as a tanky unit, so there;s no one-size-fits-all build for that.\nHowever, a damage build would look to be about:\n\n3,500 ATK\n8,000~ HP\n240+ Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n250% Crit Damage\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\nAs you can see, this one requires a higher gear quality than the normal control build, so it;s more of a late-game build (then again, Eda herself is more of a late-game PVP unit).\nNote: It is possible to sacrifice either her ring or necklace for HP% on either the Speed Build or Crit Build if necessary (such as if you;re building her as more of a tanky debuffer than anything else), but doing so means that it;ll increase the amount of Effectiveness or ATK% needed on her substats.\n",

His passive counter attacks when he is hit and can apply a random debuff of Decreased Hit Chance, Decreased Attack, Provoke, Silence and Restrict. He also cleanses 1 debuff of himself. Since the passive can proc every turn, it is recommended to have some speed on him so he can trigger his passive more often.\nHis skill 3 is a single target damage attack that does more damage every time it is used and can be stacked up to 3 times. This makes it very good for longer drawn out battles. His skill 1 provides a barrier, which is arguable his weakest skill in his arsenal.\nSince his damage scales with HP, it is best to have over 20k hp with as much crit rate and crit dmg. He thrives mostly in PVP, although you can use him in harder PvE content due to his tankiness.\nFor stats wise, you want to aim for:\n\n20k+ HP\n1.4k+ DEF\n90%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n200+ Speed\nAny effectiveness is a bonus\n\nThis will give him enough bulk and damage to be a threat.

      "description": "Elena;s kit make her more of a support healer than a primary one. Her strength lies in being able to mitigate AoE damage for all allies and provide them with AoE invincibility and bonus 50% effect resistance that stacks with whatever effect resistance they already have.\nHer skill 1 also cleanses 1 debuff off of 2 allies and if you choose to soul burn, she can cleanse all debuffs at the expense of 20 souls. Her second skill is a passive gives AoE damage reduction that heals the team based off her max health every 2 turns when she gets hit by an attack. This means she will be good against AoE teams and not as good against single target teams. Since her passive will not proc if she isn;t attacked.\nHer skill 3 provides invincibility + increased effect resistance to all allies and attacks all enemy at the same time. This can prove to be very useful against AoE attackers like Arbiter Vildred and Seaside Bellona.\nShe is an okay (not recommended) replacement for Angelic Montmorancy in terms of cleansing. Better yet, build both and have double cleansers for Guild Wars!\nHer PvE capabilities is also good since you can abuse invincibility at times in need, especially in Abyss Tower and Labyrinth Raids! However, she;s still considered to be more of a PVP unit, especially one that;s anti-AoE.\nBuild Notes\nElena actually works really well with Counter, since her s1 cleanses debuffs from her allies whenever she procs it. However, that does take a higher gear requirement, and Speed/Immunity can work well if you can;t build Counter. A good Elena build should have about:\n\n15,000+ HP\n1,500 Defense\n180%+ Effect Resistance (200% is optimal)\n230 Speed (200+ Speed if on Counter)\n\nIt;s also worth noting that Elena can;t use typical Soul Weaver artifacts like Rod of Amaryllis, due to the fact that her s3 is not a non-attack skill, even though her S2 can proc them. As such, you;ll have to use other artifacts, like Celestine or Wondrous Potion Vial. However, Magaraha;s Tome is considered the best artifact for her.\nNote: In either build, you can substitute her DEF% ring for HP% or Effect Resistance% if you have enough HP from just her necklace and substats. However, that;ll still mean it;s a little more difficult to get the optimal DEF%, as you;ll mainly have to rely on substats.\n",

He does really well in a speed cleave team since he has a high base speed.\nHe has a decent passive that gives him an attack buff and will drop a time bomb + deal damage to the highest attacker should any of your allies defeat a unit. This means he is an all in type character. Fail to kill a unit and his damage bonus doesn;t apply nor does he get perception buff. Due to him needing a lot of speed to contest for first turn, he is not recommended for new players.\nHis skill 3 can dispel 2 buffs and apply target + defense break and decrease their CR, so there is a bit of RNG there. However, when it all lands, it is pretty much a dead enemy unit.  His skill 1 will trigger a dual attack if he has the perception buff.\nSo basically, he loses his advantage if you don;t get the first kill on the enemy.

      "description": "(Updated 5/23/21)\nA strong fire ranger that provides useful buffs and debuffs. With her recent buffs, Elphelt has seen more use in PVP, now that she has Attack buff on her s2 and she has multipliers that aren;t horrendous anymore. Her artifact is also really good and now opens up options for other rangers to apply defense break as well. It;s considered to be a stronger version of Song of Stars (as Defense Break is typically considered a more useful debuff than Target), but do remember that it is limited.\nIn PvP, she shines in Guild Wars. Her skill 3 controls a unit with sleep after stripping immunity buffs. This eliminates the need for a buff stripper and opens up options for either more healers or damage dealers depending on the situation.\nOverall, she is quite versatile and can be used as a support attacker. Elphelt does her best in PVP, but she can be used as a support unit or a damage dealer, and is used best in setting up cleave teams.\nBuild Notes\nSpeed is going to be the main set you always use on Elphelt. The sub-set is what you can have more leeway with, but Immunity and Hit are the two best ones to use. Some people have built her as a full HP, Effectiveness% build, but a damage build is the best thing to build your Elphelt with. Generally, an ideal Elphelt build will be about:\n\n10,000 HP\n2,500-3,000 ATK\n900-1000 Defense\n250+ Speed\n85%+ Crit Rate (100% is still Optimal)\n280%+ Crit Damage\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\nElphelt does take a lot to build, but she is a pretty decent unit, and is worth it in the end for Arena cleaving.\n",

      "description": "Elson used to be really good until he got hit by a nerf (along with Tieria and Rikoris) and his skill 3 cooldown went up to 5 turns. That means his buff up time is no longer often enough to justify people using him.\nHis 2nd skill is an AoE heal but it heals very little. He has attack down on his first skill. He is good for early game progression and falls off later, so don;t even try to invest in him. Montmorancy is in the Connections now, just like Elson, and she;s infinitely better, even before being Specialty Changed into Angelic Montmorancy.\nBuild Notes\nHonestly, you really shouldn;t build him. But, in the off-chance that you have nothing else and you;re super-early game, you can use your free HP set until you get someone better, like Montmorancy or Achates. Once you get a better Soul Weaver, you can move that gear from Elson to them.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 11/3/21)\nEmilia is generally considered to be a ;one-size-fits-all; Soul Weaver character; she doesn;t have a specific niche that she shines in or makes her stand out ; such as how Roana punishes Seaside Bellona users, Blaze Dingo is a damage-oriented Soul Weaver, Tamarinne making PvE pretty much a breeze, and so on and so forth ; however, that is what makes her a very good unit for new players. She can fit into any new team that needs Combat Readiness, debuff dispel, healing, or barriers.\nWhile she doesn;t have any particular niche she fits in, she;s still a pretty safe unit, in that she;s consistent and can cycle her skills really fast. Don;t forget that her S2 has a 50% Combat Readiness increase; though it;s a single-target skill and only applies to one ally, it;s still very good for if a particular unit in your team needs a little boost. She;s constantly healing with her s1 and s3, and her s2 and S3 both remove 2 debuffs ; it;s not a full-cleanse for the entire team, but for what it;s worth it;s still a good skill that would keep people from immediately dying.\nInitially thought to have been ;not that great for PvP,; Emilia actually has ended up dominating the Soul Weaver scene in both Arena and RTA. Due to the fact she;s got a little bit of everything in her kit, she;s useful for just about any situation you;d need a Soul Weaver in. While she might not have a niche where she really excels, Emilia has been seeing a bunch of use in PVP due to her nature to easily slot into just about anywhere.\nBuild Notes\nYou can;t really go wrong with Emilia; she;s built like almost any other Soul Weaver ; high HP, high Defense, Speed, and Effect Resistance. She does her job well with a General Speed Build of Speed/Immunity. If you don;t have any good Immunity gear right away, the free Health set can work in a pinch; however she should have that replaced with Immunity as soon as possible.\nA good Emilia build looks to be about:\n\n15,000 HP\n1,500 Defense\n200-250 Speed (250 is the final goal to aim for)\n170%+ Effect Resistance\n\n",

When built with good stats (4k+ attack, 300%+ Crit Damage), he can deal with most bruisers, tanks and DPS.

Ruele, Krau and high health units can be taken out by S3 alone if they don;t have extremely high defense. His soul burn is now on S2, giving him extra damage alongside a large barrier, counter attack and immunity. S3 now needs to kill someone to get that extra turn.\nHis S1 also provides defense break, which is good when he is in counter attacking mode. He is, however, vulnerable to strips and gets easily taken without buffs. He also needs an attack buffer to be effective. Aside from that, he is a good hero to use against non fire units.\nBuild Notes\nErvalen is one of the few units who you don;t want to build with HP%, as his S2 and s3 both rely on having less HP than the enemy.

      "description": "[2/15/2023 Update] Her random debuff now reduces speed instead of being unhealable. \nFairytale Tenebria is an incredibly good unit, especially in PVP. She;s the only one with the new debuff, Reflected Provoke, which ; instead of making the provoked unit attack the one who provoked them ; makes the unit inflicted with that debuff attack the enemy with the highest Max HP. In other words, they will automatically go for the enemy;s tankiest unit, instead of attacking Fairytale Tenebria herself.\nAs you can see, for those lucky to have a Dark Corvus, Fairytale Tenebria would work wonders in a D.Corvus team! When F.Tenebria inflicts her Reflected Provoke, the units will automatically go for Dark Corvus, thus triggering his passive and Fairytale Tenebria;s! She works very well in debuff teams, considering how she removes buffs, adds debuffs, and forces units to go for the highest HP unit. However, she is countered by units who can cleanse, or units that reflect debuffs back (such as Champion Zerato).\nBuild Notes\nFairytale Tenebria is a late-game PVP unit. She is not to be built if you;re a new player, as she doesn;t have much use in PVE.\nYou want Fairytale Tenebria to go first, and make her your opener unit. As such, Speed and Effectiveness% is your highest priority, which emphasis on Speed. After that, HP% and DEF% is your next two priorities (so she can take some hits) and then maybe Effect Resistance% if you have any left over. However, Resistance is lowest on the priority list, and you shouldn;t aim for it over other stats.\nA very late-game, fast Fairytale Tenebria build for RTA consists of about:\n\n280+ Speed\n170%+ Effectiveness (200% and above should be aimed for)\n14,000 HP\n1,100 Defense\n\nAny leftover substats can go into Effect Resistance, but again it;s not as important as the other 4 stats.\n",

While her base speed isn;t the best, she can still be used as the PvP opener, only if you can get more than 270+ speed on her. Fallen Lidica is not to be used in PvE by early-game players, as she is so much better in PVP late-game.\nOther than that, her kit is designed to strip buff and then apply max cooldown to the enemy. This works better in guild wars situations and also in the arena against slower teams as well. She can now also get skill nullifier for allies if she deals a critical hit.\nBuild Notes\nThe three most necessary stats on Faithless Lidica is Crit Rate, Speed, and Effectiveness. You need to make sure she;s at 100% Crit Rate. That;s one of the most important stats on her. ATK%, Crit Damage% and HP% are other stats that are good on her, but they;re not necessary like the first 3 are. Faithless Lidica can be built in a fast Effectiveness% build, or a Cleave build, though not many people use the cleave build to this day.\nAn Effectiveness build looks along the lines of:\n\n100% Crit Rate (very necessary)\n270+ Speed\n150%+ Effectiveness\n10,000 HP\n\nNo one builds a tanky Faithless Lidica build, mind you. Her sole purpose is to be an opener unit to start the battle. Not many people have built a cleaving build for F.Lidica these days, so there is very little information for a cleave build on her, and it;s not enough to create a ;recommended stats; to aim for.\nNote: In the Effectiveness build, whether you use Crit Rate% or Crit Damage% as her necklace main-stat is dependent on whether or not you can get her to 100% Crit Rate with just substats.\n",

She;s been nerfed before, but her kit as-is is still extremely strong, especially once you get her Skill Tree fully enhanced. It;s very possible for her to lock down a unit with her s3, even with the nerf. Her s1 increases her own Combat Readiness, and with her Skill Tree maxed she;ll also increase the CR of a random ally, too.\nSince her S3 doesn;t attack, it doesn;t have to worry about landing or missing the attack due to elemental advantage. All she would have to worry about is the Accuracy/Resistance check; even then, with her s3 soulburned, she won;t have to do that either. Falconcer Fluri can absolutely lock an enemy unit of your choice down and leave them vulnerable. She;s at her best in PVP, though she does have her spots in PvE.\nBuild Notes\nThere are two ways to build Falconer Kluri: the Fast Tank build and the Counter build. With the Fast Tank build, you build her Speed/Hit (though you can also substitute Hit for Immunity if you have the good gear). A good Fast Tank build in the late-game looks to be something like:\n\n280+ Speed\n18,000+ HP\n1,300+ Defense\nAs much Effectiveness as possible (100%+ recommended)\n\nEffect Resistance can be a little extra stat that you can dump into her once you get all four other stats to your satisfaction, but you shouldn;t sacrifice any other stats for her Resistance.\nA Counter Build requires even higher gear requirement than Fast Tank, since Counter gear doesn;t add any extra stats by itself. The Counter Build must be paired with Elbris Ritual Sword, for maximum Combat Readiness pushing. A late-game Counter Build looks along the lines of:\n\n200+ Speed\n18,000 HP\n1,500 DEF\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\n",

Her kit is great at disrupting enemy team from dealing damage to the DPS. Her auto barrier passive shields allies every turn. That means if the enemy does not have enough damage on the first turn, they will fail against your team most likely.\nIt is possible to build Fallen Cecilia with a bruiser-damage build, but that takes a lot more gear requirements than a straight-up tank build. She pairs up insanely well with a lot of units (e.g. Landy, Cerise, Tempest Surin), and makes it much easier for them to survive in PVP.\nBuild Notes\nThere are two ways to build Fallen Cecilia: you can use the General Speed Build, or the Counter Build. With the Speed build, you;ll want to build her as a pure, unfiltered tank. Her sole purpose is to make massive shields, soak up damage, and apply Skill Nullifier. On the Counter Build, she leans more into the bruiser-oriented way to build her. It;s a very late-game build that should not be attempted by newer players, as the gear requirements is insanely high.\nWith the General Speed Build build, the optimal F.Ceci stats to aim for will look like:\n\n30,000 HP\n250 Speed (to place Skill Nullifier on)\n1,500 Defense\n\nThe Counter build requires a lot more, though.

Her S3 does not deal damage ; though this may seem like a downside at first, it;s actually an upside. This is because she;s not burdened by elemental disadvantage and missing her target; similar to Falconer Kluri. However, she still has to go through the resistance-accuracy check, and doesn;t have a soulburn to ignore effect resistance.\nDespite this, her debuffs would make for a great opener for any cleave team. Her S2 is also unique, in that she;s the first playable unit with the Increase Critical Damage buff; it can be used on one of your allies should the battle not be over after all your units get a turn. Plus, with her new soulburn, she can immediately S3 and then combo into her S2 to set up your nuker.\nBuild Notes\nYou want Flan with three substats in mind: Speed, HP%, and Effectiveness. There are two ways to build Flan: either you focus on her Speed or Effectiveness. The Fast Support build is going to be used in both of these builds, but the focus on her substats is what changes.

Upon gaining 3 wisdom stacks, she can unleash an extra AoE attack that can dispel enemy buffs, inflict sleep and defense break. It does have a long cooldown though.\nHer skill 3 is a single target disable that reduces enemy buff duration by 1, decrease speed and combat readiness well dealing fixed damage depending on her Wisdom stacks.

He;s easy to acquire and provides a reliable Defense Break, along with constant Crit Rate buffs, which lowers the gear requirements the damage dealers need. On top of that, he;s available through Hero Connections, meaning you really have no reason to not use him.\nFurious has constant uptime on his s3 once you skill up both his s2 and his S3: He;ll use his s2 to plant his Crit Rate buff, grant himself an extra turn, and then uses his s3 for 2-turn defense break. This, in turn, makes his s3 practically 2 turns long, due to his extra turn.\nBuild Notes\nFurious really only needs three stats ; Speed, HP, and Effectiveness%. He only needs 65% Effectiveness, as any more will end up being a waste. Furious needs to be at least 11 Speed faster than your damage dealer (and should preferably go first), to make sure no one can cut ahead of him. There are two ways to build him: a Wyvern 13 build with General Purrgis and a build without General Purrgis.\nA Furious build without General Purrgis looks to be about:\n\nAt least 196 Speed (recommended to go higher, so he always goes first. 196 is the bare minimum to get 4 turns before the Wyvern;s barrier)\n65% Effectiveness\n8,000~ HP\n\nWith General Purrgis, you can go much easier on the Speed requirement ; the bare minimum he;d need to ensure he always gets 4 turns before the Wyvern;s barrier is around 135.\n",

Top tier in Guild Wars as you can afford to bring more attackers. Do keep in mind that he won;t be doing much damage and is mostly used for first/second turn PvP to mess up enemy team rotation, along with his passive.\nFor his Exclusive Equipment, it;s really recommended to use the ;extra Combat Readiness; option.\nBuild Notes\nIf you;re building him for Wyvern 13, all you need to worry about is being a tank. He needs high HP, high Defense, maybe Effect Resistance, and either Sepulcrum or Proof of Valor. Using the free 75 Health gear is enough for him here; using the Full Tank Build is enough. For Wyvern 13, you want his stats to look something along the lines of:\n\n25,000 HP\n1,500 Defense\n150~ Speed\n\nThat;s about all you need; of course, you need to equip your G.Purrg with Proof of Valor or Sepulcrum, too. Effect Resistance isn;t as necessary, but you can stack some on your G.Purrg just in case.\nFor PVP use, you;ll need to use the Speed Tank build; you can;t get by with just 3 HP sets, as Immunity becomes somewhat necessary to make sure someone like Archdemon;s Shadow can;t seal him, or Cerise can;t restrict him (the rest of the team is a different story). The stats you need is more or less the same with the PVP use, though the only change is becoming around 200~ Speed.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 7/31/21)\nIn this batch of 3 star heroes (Godmother, Glenn, Ian, Sonia and Ainos), Glenn here is definitely the best of the bunch. He;s our first 3-star unit with Extinction, making him an effective budget unit against pesky units like Arbiter Vildred, Ruele, or Roana! However, he is burdened by his low stats that make him hard to gear up, so you;re going to need a lot of Attack substats for him. However, he does have Crit Rate and Crit Damage awakenings, along with Greater Attack on his S3.\nHe actually did get to see some use the first few days when he was released ; the combo of his s3 into his s2 is able to burst down particularly pesky units and inflicts extinction on them if he kills them. This deletes them entirely from the match, leaving the rest of his team able to focus on everyone else. Though Glenn isn;t a widely-picked unit these days, he still works as a budget Extinction unit, should you want to go up against reviver units and you don;t have better choices (e.g. Sigret, Sinful Angelica, etc.)\nBuild Notes\nGlenn is pretty hard to build, due to his low base ATK; however, this is somewhat mitigated by his Crit Rate and Crit Damage awakenings. The four main stats you want to lump into him are ATK%, Speed, Crit Rate%, and Crit Damge%; in other words, the typical one-shot build. As his base speed of 110 is pretty decent, it would benefit him greatly to have a Speed set as his main stat, followed by either a Crit set or Immunity. He can work fine with any generic ;DPS unit on a Speed set; piece of gear, really.\nA good build for him looks to be about:\n\n3,000 ATK\n220~ Speed\n100% Crit Chance\n300%+ Crit Damage\n\nHis turn order isn;t as important as other teams, as he doesn;t need to wait for another unit to set him up. As mentioned, he can pull his s3, gain the extra turn, and then use his S2 with his Greater ATK buff.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 8/1/21)\nGreat Chief Khawana is in a bit of a weird spot right now. She;s easy to build, because her passive increases her Crit Chance by 20% (30% when fully skilled up), and her s3 will help her output more damage. However, her extra damage from her passive only procs when an enemy triggers a Dual Attack. This, combined with the situational 2-turn Restrict on her s1, makes her a prime candidate for the Caides Hunt.\n;Which is a Hunt that isn;t farmed very often, because the sets aren;t worth it.\nBecause her passive is so reliant in enemy Dual Attacks, Great Chief Khawana is only usable in PvE, and her PVP use is limited ; if not downright nonexistent. Compare this to other units like Roana (whose passive triggers whenever an enemy has an off-turn attack such as extra attacks and counterattacks, not just Dual Attacks), and you;ll see why Great Chief Khawana can;t be used in PVP. It relies too much on one specific off-turn attack.\nAll in all, Great Chief Khawana is a beautiful unit who unfortunately suffers from a passive that;s too limited to one place in order to really be useful.\nBuild Notes\nBuilding ML Khawana to 100% Crit Rate is easy, as her s2 Crit Chance increase is similar to Lena;s. Generally, you;ll want to aim for about:\n\n3,500 ATK\n85% Crit Rate\n250-300%+ Crit Rate\n190 Speed\n65% Effectiveness\n\nThis is a build to be used on Caides Hunt, mind you. If you;re not using her in Caides, it;s just best to put her on 100% Crit Rate right then and there. It;s also a good idea to get her to about 10,000-13,000 HP, so she doesn;t immediately die.\n",

He hits super hard but he also dies pretty easily. His kit all revolves around doing big damage and have a bit of heal regen and barrier to keep himself alive; making him a weird hybrid ;damage dealer who also heals a little bit; type of mage. This makes him similar to Blaze Dingo;s kit ; however, the main difference between them is that Blaze Dingo is meant to deal high damage and high heals, while G.Aither;s kit is more of a kit that does damage and adds a bit of survivability as a cherry on top.\nGuider Aither works best in PvE, because of his high-damage outputs. Due to his lack of health, he is not too good in higher Abyss floors. For PvP, he is okay as a nuker but often times too frail to take hits. You will need to sacrifice some damage to make him survive or use a Combat Readiness booster character (examples being Auxiliary Lots, Flan, etc.) to give him a turn. As such, it;s usually not recommended to bring him into PvP.\nBuild Notes\nYou;ll want to stack up as much ATK as you can on Aither, as his barrier amount is based off of it. After that comes the normal DPS stats needed ; SPD, Crit DMG%, and Crit Rate%; it;ll help with the amount of healing he grants to his allies on his s3. G.Aither can also benefit with some HP% and Defense% substats on him too for survivability, but it;s not as high a priority on him.\nA good G.Aither build looks to be about:\n\n4,500+ ATK\n8,000~ HP\n1,000 Defense\n200~ Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n280% Crit Damage\n\n",

That means if you stack attack to 4000, his bleed stack will deal 30% of that, which is 1200 per tick.  With his passive that gives him bonus attack, its attainable with decent gear.\nIf you have an attack buffer, his base attack will improve and he hurts. He is terrible for PvE but will be okay in PvP, as bleeds are effective over time. Plus now, he has built in critical hit resistance and it improves his tankiness.\nHis third skill is a stun and can defense break for 2 turns! Also, he is now a strong counter against evasion units such as Violet, ML Violet, Mirsa and A. Cartuja etc. He is also a very good unit to use in Lilias cleave comps, as Lilias;s s3 deals damage based off of her ally with the highest ATK. Gunther would be guaranteed to be the unit with the highest ATK in the team, thus ensuring Lilias can do some immense damage with her s3.\nBuild Notes\nSeeing as Gunther can;t land a critical hit, you;ll want to stack as much ATK on him as possible. This makes him one of the few units who actually benefits more on an Attack set more than Destruction. Gunther;s a bit more of a meme unit, so there;s no ;one-size-fits-all; build for him, except to ;stack on as much ATK as you can, and any other sets can be secondary.;\nYou;ll want to have at least 4500+ ATK on him by the time you;re done.

Testing will be required after the change.\nHasol is a budget unit to counter units that like to attack when it is not their turn. Mainly characters like Violet, Charles or Belian for example. Upon taking a counter attack, she gains combat readiness and her S2 passive gains 1000 fixed damage, up to 4 times.\nThis allows her to gradually take them down with the increased fixed damage and heal herself as well. She herself is pretty tanky and her S3 provides 3 turn defense buff for the whole team. Most of the time, you will be waiting for the counter attacks to stack your passive and finish them in longer fights.\nShe will excel against bruiser counter teams with little to no sustain. However, if there isn;t any unit that is particularly counterattack heavy, then Hasol is limited to maybe 500 damage. She isn;t a unit that you can take into any team and instantly win; you would have to plot to take her against a specific type of team.\nBuild Notes\nDON;T put Hasol on counterattack; it would be utterly wasted on her. Even though she can heal herself on her s1 in counterattacking, her fixed damage only applies on her turn. The fixed damage that Hasol builds up doesn;t apply to her own counterattacks, either; only enemy counterattacks work.\nThe only build that really works on Hasol is the General Speed Build. Speed, HP and Defense are all of the best substats that you can put on her.\nGenerally, you;ll want Hasol;s stats to look like this:\n\n200+ Speed\n20,000+ HP (More is always better)\n 1,500 Defense\n50% Effectiveness\n50% Effect Resistence\n\n",

      "description": "(8/3/2023 Update): S1 is now a defense break, with S3 getting a lower cooldown.\nSo with the new changes, his kit is actually very useful now. His skill 3, aside from inflicting bleed, can now dispel 2 buffs and potentially defense break enemies. This gives him an incentive to go first so he can strip buffs. He has a good base speed, so he can definitely contest for first move. Due to this, he is not only useful for PvE, he is also usable in PvP.\nHis skill 2 remains unchanged and is useful in applying debuffs. His skill 1 now decreases defense, which is a much better option than bleed. He is still strong in Golem hunt and does well in other such as Labyrinth, also Raid and Abyss in certain areas. He has been neglected for too long and has now seen the buff he needs to compete in the end game.\nBuild Notes\nFor now, a general build of stacking up towards ATK%, Crit Rate%, Crit DMG%, and SPD is fine. There are no solid numbers, mind you, but those are the stats to go for. However, for an end game PvP build:\n\n2.5k+ Attack\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n270+ Speed\nAny effectiveness is a bonus\n\nThis is the bare minimum to compete in higher arena (challenger+) for speed, but if you can;t meet it, PvE does not require that much speed to do well. For PvE Golem hunt, he is fine having low speed and very high attack.\n",

Of these five, Hataan may be the one who;s seen the least use out of them all, and it;s not very difficult to see why. His s1;s soulburn is pretty much all but wasted, as he only has a 75% chance to land his Miss debuff, even when he ignores Effect Resistance.\nHis s2;s decent enough, as it;s basically a budget version of Vivian;s s2, but do note that it;s only a single-target attack. It can only activate once as well, meaning you;re only able to kill two enemies at a time. His s3 actually isn;t that bad, either ; it increases everyone;s ATK for 2 turns, and his Speed for 2 turns as well.\nHowever, there are way better and more obtainable farmers (such as Lena, Free Spirit Tieria, etc.) and other units who are also reliable with buffing their team and debuffing the enemies. Building Hataan with his current skillset just isn;t worth it.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/28/21)\nWith the Specialty Change to Mascot Hazel, Hazel is a great starter support healer for new players. She has unhealable debuff on her first skill, single target heal on her second and team heal + attack buff on her third.\nShe is viable in Golem Hunt, Abyss and Raid. Once you get her some attack, hp and speed, she will be very useful as a support healer. She isn;t much of a PvP character, but can be used as a substitute attack buffer in lower arena ranks below Master. Overall, Hazel is more or less just a PvE Soul Weaver to use. She;s held back by her low stats, especially her Speed.\nAdmittedly, there are other Soul Weavers that do her job much better, such as Angelic Montmorancy ; another 3-star unit who can be Specialty Changed. Overall, Hazel (and Mascot Hazel, by extension) is a pretty okay unit for newer players, but isn;t a must-have or a game-breaking unit.\nBuild Notes\nThese Build Notes are meant to be more as a buildup to Mascot Hazel ; essentially laying down the groundwork for her Specialty Change. Like most Soul Weavers, Hazel needs HP%, Defense%, Speed, and Effect Resistance%. However, she also needs ATK% as well, as her heals are based off of her ATK and her target;s max HP.\nWhen you first start the game as an early-game player, you can use the free Attack and Health set that you get as her gear, however the Attack set is much more suited towards a damage dealer instead of an ATK-based healer. There is a good chance that you don;t have anything better for an Attack set, mind you, so if you really don;t have any other Soul Weavers or gear, using that on Hazel will do.\nOnce you get some decent gear, you can replace the Attack set with Speed. Getting Immunity on her will be more a later-game thing, so Health can work fine on her too.\nA good Hazel build (and Mascot Hazel build, at that) looks to be about:\n\n1,500 ATK\n1,600 DEF\n16,000~ HP\n200~ Speed\n150% Effect Resistance at the minimum\n\nThis is not a build that can be easily obtained by newer players, but can instead be more of a goal to work towards.\n",

She;s actually pretty similar to Inferno Khawazu in that regard ; needs to fight an AoE unit, otherwise they;re not at their full potential. She works as a somewhat tanky damage dealer who deals damage based off of her Defense.\nHelen;s main flaw is her low base stats, especially her Speed, which would make her a little hard to gear up if you don;t have any good gear.\nBuild Notes\nHelen works with the General Speed Build of Speed/Immunity. As for her artifacts, she;s one of the few units who can work on Ancient Dragon;s Legacy. If you pick AD;sL as her artifact, she would only need 85% Crit Rate, due to the built in 15% Crit Rate increase in the arti. However, if you choose, say, Elbris Ritual Sword or Aurius, you;d have to put her at 100% Crit Rate for maximum damage.\nAn optimal Helen build looks to be about:\n\n14,000 HP\n2,100+ DEF (the more, the better)\n170~ Speed\n85%-100% Crit Rate\n260%+ Crit Damage\n\n",

      "description": "(Updated 04/8/22)\nWith the new changes, she could be viable in the meta once more. Needs some testing.\nThese days H.Yufine;s place in the meta has all but fallen off. She;s made to be a Basar counter; and that;s it. She can;t really do that properly either whenever he;s paired with Politis, due to how she decreases the amount of Combat Readiness gain that the enemies get to receive. Although she has no non-attack skills in her kit (thankfully making her unable to trigger the other half of Politis;s s2), a large part of her kit is pushing her allies; Combat Readiness, and Politis greatly limits that.\nThat;s not to say she;s a bad unit, though ; she is pretty good, and her kit is nice, but she;s just not in the meta anymore. Due to her skills being all AoE, it;s incredibly easy for her to be countered in the current meta of anti-AoE and counterattacks. Angel of Light Angelica, Rem, Violet, etc. will easily eat her alive if she so much as breathes funny. There are still teams that she can do well against, but the primary teams in the arena right now definitely oppress her.\nHer skill 3 attacks all enemies, cleanses 2 debuffs and increase combat readiness and attack of all allies. Her skill 2 passive is what makes her good against Basar. Since it increases evasion by 35% (and an additional 35% too), Basar is all but guaranteed to miss, allowing her to cleanse debuffs and counter push your own allies. The passive also reduces combat readiness pushback as well.\nHer skill 1 is an AoE burn attack which ignores elemental disadvantage (but it is a single target when she dual attacks). Just like with Dizzy;s lack of single-target, this AoE attack is a double-edged sword; especially so in the meta of Rem + Violet.\nBuild Notes\nWhen building H.Yufine, the best build for her will be the General Speed Build, of Speed + Immunity. She;s pretty stat-hungry as a unit, so to get her to the ideal H.Yufine build is going to be a bit difficult.\nThe ideal H.Yufine build looks to be about:\n\n230+ Speed\n13,000 HP\n1,500 Defense\n3,000+ ATK\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n\nIf you;re going for a bulkier build that relies less on her Crit Rate and Crit Damage, you can definitely achieve higher stats for the first 4 stats (15,000+ HP, 3.5k+ ATK, etc.). However, do note that these are pretty end-game stats, and it won;t be very easy to achieve them immediately.\nHaving the limited artifact Junkyard Dog from Guilty Gear collab makes her skill 1 so much better. However, it is not available for everyone, as it;s a limited artifact. As of right now, Guide to a Decision is one of the best artifact choices for her. It;s obtainable, but needs to be +30;d to be reliable.\n",

      "description": "Note (10/27/2022): Hwayoung;s attack is nerfed and also her defense penetration is now conditional.\nWith the big nerfs, she will most likely not be able to one shot a majority of the units. Some testing required to see where she stands after this.\nOutdated: Let;s not beat around the bush here ; Hwayoung is insane. She;s easily one of the strongest single-target damage dealers in the game. Although Hwayoung doesn;t have the ability to trigger a critical hit, she more than makes up for it with the entire rest of her kit. With her high base ATK, a boost in ATK in her passive, extra damage in her s1, barriers to keep her alive, and her s3 having an incredible damage scaling, it;s no wonder why everyone wants a copy of her.\nWhile she isn;t usable in PvE, she;s definitely got her uses in PvP: that use being to obliterate nearly everyone and everything in sight. Hwayoung does rely on having less HP than her enemy in order to get the maximum amount of potential from her s3, but that doesn;t mean building her is harder than other single-target units.\nBuild Notes\nThere are only two real stats for a player to worry about when building their Hwayoung; that being ATK% and SPD. HP% is only a little necessary, up to a certain point. It;s been figured out that 12,000 HP is all that a Hwayoung needs; this will be the sweet spot between having the full HP scaling and still having HP that;s low enough to take down a large amount of units.\nSome people have put her on Counter before, but someone looking for a guaranteed safe build should go for Speed. Of course, Crit Rate and Crit DMG would be completely wasted on her.\nGenerally, you;ll want your Hwayoung;s stats to look like this:\n\n12,000 HP\n1,500 DEF\n6,500+ ATK (7,000 and up is preferable; some people can get up to 8,000)\n180~ Speed\n\nIt;s very easy to stack ATK on Hwyaoung, due to her high base attack and her passive.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 13/4/2022): Ilynav now loses the defense debuff on S2 but gains more damage.\nIlynav is a very interesting unit, though she relies quite a bit on RNG. Her s1 is similar to Charles, in that she has a good chance to trigger her s2 on her s1. (The main difference is that Charles; s1 combos into his s2, while Ilynav;s s1 has a chance to be replaced by her s2 when not part of a dual attack.) Her base s1 isn;t the best, though, as it has no debuffs or anything special to offer, besides having a chance to become her s2. Her s2 is probably one of her best skills, as she;s one of the first units who can truly utilize Injury now.\nNotice that the wording on her S1 only says ;not a dual attack,; and not ;counterattacks or dual attacks.; This means that Elbris Ritual Sword and Counter sets do work on her s2. She;s at her best in PVP (such as Arena or Guild Wars), and her multipliers that scale off of her Max HP are very good, especially on her s2.\nWhen she doesn;t trigger her s2, her s1 is quite literally useless ; it offers no debuffs or buffs whatsoever, meaning you;re praying on an unreliable chance to use the actually good skill. Overall, Ilynav does have potential in her kit. She just needs something to nudge her in the right direction needed to make her S1 useful for her kit to be fully usable.\nBuild Notes\nIlynav;s Max HP multipliers are very good, so it would be in your best interest to build her with HP%, Crit Damage%, and Crit Rate. Speed is an essential stat as well. DEF% is a decent stat to put on her, but it;s more of a lower priority stat than everything else; it;s going to be used to make her a bigger meat shield.\nIlynav;s ideal stats look along the lines of:\n\n21,000 HP\n200 Speed (Only 180+ needed in Counter Build)\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit Damage\n1,300 Defense\n\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/10/21)\nInferno Khawazu is an extremely fun unit in PVP! He;s one of the two units who can plant Vigor on himself, in exchange for good things happening. When he has vigor, his 75% burn chance on his s1 becomes 100% and plants two Burns on the enemy, and his burns on his S3 ignores Effect Resistance on Vigor. After that, his S3 detonates all burns in the enemy. On top of that, his passive pretty much punishes any unit who uses an AoE skill ; if he;s hit with an attack that targets all allies he removes all debuffs on himself, heals based on his Attack power, and increases his Combat Readiness by 20% before putting Vigor on himself. Granted, it;s only usable once every 2 turns, but considering how he has 2-turn Vigor, it;s pretty much just constant Vigor cycling if you;re lucky.\nHe;s been tested in Arena a lot these past few weeks, and it;s been proven that he can actually pop Tempest Surin from under Fallen Cecilia, without proc;ing her insanely annoying passive. Fallen Cecilia will put skill nullifier on Tempest Surin, which will then activate Inferno Khawazu;s passive, and sets him up for his s3 ; the skill nullifier negates any damage on his s3 that might trigger Surin;s passive ahead of time, but his dispel will destroy any barrier or immunity she has, place the burns, and then detonate. This detonation should be able to burst down T.Surin if you;ve built Khawazu with enough ATK.\nThe only two teams that he really can;t shine his best in are teams with no AoE attacks and Champion Zerato teams. (As it turns out, C.Zerato transfers debuffs back before the detonation can occur.) However, when he;s drafted against the right team, he can very much carry the battle with a lucky AoE hit! He pairs up great with Researcher Carrot, too.\nBuild Notes\nThere are two ways you can build Inferno Khawazu: the regular Fast Burns build, or the Counter Build. It;s a lot harder to build him with counterattack, since Counter gear doesn;t offer any gains to stats and he;s already slow as-is. The Counter Build is mostly to be considered as a fun joke idea to play around with, but if you;re going for a serious ;works every time; build, then Fast Burns is the way to go.\nInferno Khawazu is one of the few damage-dealing units where you don;t want to put any Crit Damage or Crit Rate on him, because Burns deal more damage based off of the caster;s Attack. On top of that, his multipliers on the actual skills aren;t that very good; even if you build him Destruction/Crit with the best Crit Damage/Rate stats possible, you won;t be doing any real nuking with him. The best stats to aim for are Attack and Speed, with HP% and Def% also being pretty necessary. Effectiveness% isn;t a must-have stat on him, considering how his s3 ignores Resistance; however, some recommend putting some on him just in case (also for his S1).\nA good Inferno Khawazu build looks like:\n\n4,000+ ATK (at the bare minimum)\n200+ Speed\n18,000 HP\n1,500 Defense\n\nNote: Should you find yourself lacking in Effectiveness, it;s alright to switch out the Immunity in Fast Burns for Hit until you can get good Immunity gear on him. However, Immunity on the Counter Build is necessary for him (and for pretty much anyone built Counter).\nNote 2: Inferno Khawazu specifically uses Oath Key and not A Symbol of Unity when putting an artifact on him to counter Tempest Surin. You don;t want the extra damage that Unity gives, because T.Surin;s passive cleanses her of all debuffs and increases her Combat Readiness if someone ends a turn with her below 70% HP. Khawazu;s Burn detonation goes through her passive;s ;can;t take more than 51% damage in one turn; effect, and her ;Cleans debuffs if below 70% HP;.\n",

      "description": "Infinite Horizon Achates is a versatile healer that can cleanse, provide combat readiness for herself and allies. Her kit is much more suited for taking on medium debuff teams. Against very heavy debuffers, she will get overwhelmed.\nSince her random buff is not reliable at giving your entire team a specific setup, it all depends on your luck. Hence, she is not very consistent.\nHowever, her other kit such as her S2, which gives CR push, cleanse and barrier to 1 ally will suit bruisers or tanks much better since most of the time, they do not need an attack buff to deal increased damage. Her S1 can stun an enemy, which can come in clutch at times.\nIdeally, you want her to be relatively fast so that she can get her S3 off after the enemy has moved. As such, effect resistance or immunity will be important. Here is the stat guideline:\n\n1.8k+ DEF\n17k+ HP\n180+ Speed\nAny effectiveness is great\n150%+ Effect Resistance\n\nShe is suited for PvP such as Guild Wars or Arena.

      "description": "(Updated 11/1/21)\nIseria;s kit is pretty much one of the few future-proof kits in the game. No matter how the meta changes, she;s pretty much guaranteed to be useful as long as her kit doesn;t get any changes. Her s2 offers a full skill reset to any of her allies (which is great for units like Tamarinne or Dark Corvus), and her s3 consists of a single-target buff strip, defense break, and unbuffable.\nShe;s insanely good for PvE, and can really help set up her allies to do their job properly. The Tamarinne + Iseria pair is still really good in Abyss floors, too ; Tamarinne;s s3 starts on a full cooldown, so Iseria can easily refresh the cooldown for her Idol form. She can also pair up well with Dark Corvus, though Iseria + D.Corvus is a bit of a weird combo in PvP that;s not seen often.\nAdmittedly, there are places where Iseria isn;t so great in. She;s not going to shine too well in Wyvern, due to her being an Earth element against a fire boss. Additionally, drafting her in RTA can be a bit risky, because there;s always a chance your enemy will ban her and wreck any team set up around her.\nBuild Notes\nSince Iseria is such a popular unit, there;s a lot of stats and guides for building her. In the PvE build, you;ll want to use Speed and Hit Rate, to maximize as much Effectiveness% as you can get on her. In PvP, she;d do better on an Immunity set instead of Hit Rate. This can also work as her build for Abyss floors, as a lot of stages are debuff-heavy.\nThe goal for a good Iseria build looks to be about:\n\n17,000+ HP\n1,100 DEF\n250 Speed\n2,000 ATK\n120%+ Effectiveness (More is always better)\n\nDo note that new players can;t immediately achieve these stats; especially not her Speed.

      "description": "Note: (Updated 6-8-23)\nJack-O; is a pretty fun PvP unit. Her passive provides a 25% debuff chance for the ally in the backline for 2 turns. The cool thing about the passive is that it will still activate on a miss on the enemy, much like abyssal crown. So the best units to use in the backline are units with AoE attacks. Belian, Politis, Seaside Bellona, Summer Iseria, Peira, Ran and so on. Once an enemy is gets a debuff by her passive from her ally, she gets bonus combat readiness. There is some RNG element there, which can be fun;or not.\nHer S3 is a decent single target attack that provides attack buff and defense penetration. Allies get bonus CR push if she kills an enemy. S3 does require debuffs for bonus damage. The same goes for S1. If enemy has a debuff, she gets an extra attack and stealth mode! Keep in mind that if her S1 kills a debuffed enemy, her S1 proc will hit another enemy instead.\nThe problem is that she needs a team that can debuff the enemies to make her shine. If she is built with heavy offense, there is not much left for survivability and effectiveness stat. High effect resist teams and cleansers are a huge threat to her ability to do well. I guess that is the trade off for having a passive that provides team utility.\nShe is a lot stronger now though after the changes. The team CR push is a much better fit in heavy debuff speed teams.\nBuild Notes\nShe is stat hungry and will require top gear to perform well.\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit Damage\n200+ Speed\n\nEffectiveness stat is a bonus if you can get some on it. Anything more than 0% is great, but it;s not really necessary for her. Speed can be sacrificed if you can;t get 3.5k+ attack with at least 250% crit damage. As a pure attacker, her survivability will be bad. She needs some form of damage mitigation to be safe; someone like an Aurius Knight or someone who can apply heavy barriers will work.\nArtifact Note: There aren;t really that many artifacts that work that well with Jack-O, but Merciless Glutton is her best bet. Uberius;s Tooth is fine, but it;s not really that great for her.\n",

      "description": "(Written 7-20-22)\nYeah, Januta;s a bit of a dud. He;s easily the worst 3 star of the batch he came in (Januta, Orte, Muwi, Yoonryoung and Hasol), and it;s not pretty hard to see why. Both his passive and his s3 relies heavily on his allies being attacked ; thanks to his Enraged effect only triggering at a 35% chance when maxed out when allies are attacked and needing Rage to ignore EffRes ; and his s3 by itself is just underwhelming.\nSure, his s3;s debuff can ignore Effect Resistance when he;s enraged, but is it really that big of a deal? The correct answer is no ; all his S3 does is give one enemy a 2-turn Speed decrease, before increasing his own Attack for 2 turns. Overall, Januta just doesn;t really do anything, and you would probably be better off using anyone else as a damage dealer.\nBuild Notes\nNo one;s really built Januta, so there;s no real build notes, beyond just a general ;this artifact works fine, this build is okay.; He should be replaced as soon as possible, really.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 11/3/21)\nJecht is a somewhat viable Soul Weaver during the beginning of the game for PvE use (specifically Banshee Hunts), if you really have nothing else cleansing-wise. He boasts a passive that works like a built-in Wondrous Potion Vial; once fully skilled up, he;ll remove a debuff inflicted on an ally at the beginning of each turn. His s3 is also semi-useful too, as it grants Continuous Healing to all of his allies for 2 turns. He;s also one of the few units who has Speed imprint, as well.\nHowever, there are multiple things that hold him back. His base HP is disgustingly low (even for Soul Weavers), and his DEF isn;t the best either. He doesn;t offer any direct healing in his kit either ; any healing he provides comes from his Continuous Healing buff ; and his s2;s debuff removal is a bit randomized, with no other cleanse in his kit.\nOverall, Jecht can work if you have no one else, but remember that both Montmorancy and Angelica are now available in Hero Connections just like him. Angelica, with her Exclusive Equipment, removes a debuff off of all allies with her s3, and Montmorancy (once changed to Angelic Montmorancy) can easily cycle her s2 and s3 for constant debuff removal. They also both have large amounts of direct healing; something that Jecht can;t say the same for.\nBuild Notes\nSeeing as how no one is building Jecht, there;s no ;one-size-fits-all; build for him. However, until you can find a better Soul Weaver, he can work just fine with the free 75 HP gear you;re given early game. Otherwise, Speed + HP will be fine on him, too. Just pump his substats towards HP%, DEF%, and Speed. Effect Resistance% is lower priority, but it;s still recommended to give him some.\n",

More testing will have to be done to say for sure, so please take all info here with a grain of salt until January the 6th, 2022.\n;;\nHer third skill reduces all enemy skill cooldowns, forcing them to use only basic attack. If she gets that off, the fight is usually over. Opponent teams need to bring immunity set just to counter her alone, which is a big resource investment. With the new update, her S2 has been moved into her s3, which gets a 75% chance to dispel a buff, which is useful in stripping immunity sets and applying skill reset if you soul burn.\nShe also gives defense break on her first skill, which is extremely useful in both PvE and PvP situations. That makes her a great all around unit, but I would say she shines more in PvP with her kit.\nHaving a mage with a +30 Tagahel;s Ancient Book for the soul burn is vital in making her S2 to S3 combo work on offense.\n",

However, he has immortality buff when his health gets reduced to 0, which allows him to be built full attack and not worry about dying on the first turn.\nIf you have a buff on Kayron, his basic attack will become AoE. Some people like to run immunity set on him and he gets an AoE attack right out the gate.\nHis third skill is a strong single target nuke. He gets free attack buff after using it. Killing any enemy will also extend his buff, which means more survivability.\nHis immortality buff can no longer be blocked by anti buff debuff.\n",

This makes him a terror in Guild Wars, as he can kill any of your squishy units and even tanks if he is given a turn when low on health.\nI would be hesitant to attack Krau teams in Guild Wars if I don;t want to lose specific units.\n",

      "description": "Post Buff Update 26/11/2020:\nLandy;s strength lies in being self sufficient since she does not always need an attack buff due to her passive, which provides bonus attack. However, it still does take some attacks to charge her up. So any dual attacks is going to help speed up the process.\nHer skill 3 is an AoE attack that cannot be counterattacked and also pushes all allies combat readiness + a speed buff to boot, along with penetrating everyone;s defense by 50%. It is best against buff heavy teams as it charges the fighting spirit up quickly.\nHer skill one also allows her to cycle her skills faster as it increases her own combat readiness (more if enemy has a buff).\nThis makes her perfect for Azimank hunts as she will always deal bonus damage since the boss always have the tendency to generate buffs herself after she gets attacked.\nAfter the post buff, she is now very powerful against buff heavy teams in PvP. She can usually use her skill 3 twice if the enemy has enough buffs and her attacks really start to stack up and hurt after the first skill 3.\n",

This allows her to snipe out key targets.\nHer S3 grants her attack buff, self cleanses 2 debuffs and gives bonus damage buff that scales with enemy health. Her S2 is her key nuking skill that gives additional bonus hit rate, allowing her to deal with evasion type units.. Her combo goes from S3 into S2 and grants herself and stealth + barrier. This improves her overall survivability.\nHer S1 gives some CR push when used. Since she does scale with speed, you will want her at a decent speed, at least 200+ to take advantage of that.\nShe works well in a team comp with supports that can push her CR or mitigate damage for her. Abigial is a good teammate to help her out with surviving. She is quite squishy though and will die to strong single target counter attacks.\nStat wise, it is easy to build.\n\n3k+ Attack\n1k Def\n8k+ HP\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n200+ Speed\n\nIf you can get her speed as high as 260+, she will really shine.\n",

      "description": "Lilibet is great against any team that runs a reviver. She does best against Arbiter Vildred and Ruele;s in PvP. Her S1 has unable to be buffed debuff, her S2 provides some bleeds, which compliments Baiken (but new players won;t have her). If she lands bleeding on the target, she gets another turn.\nHer biggest take is her S3, which makes any unit she kills with this skill rest in their tombstones forever. Now any team that can revive won;t be much of an issue. However, you need your Lilibet to do enough damage to ensure the target dies. Her soul burn multipliers are high, so that won;t be an issue.\nAside from fighting revivers in PvP, she doesn;t have much to offer for PvE besides being a single target damage dealer. There are other options like Cermia, Luna, Commander Lorina or Sol Badguy that are ahead of the packing order for PvE.\nWith her exclusive equipment which gives her +20% hit chance, she can now use other damage artifacts like Tonfa/Portrait to one shot damage dealers with revive teammates.\n[2/17/2022 Update] ; Her S2 gives her combat readiness increase instead of extra damage. Now there is an incentive to land bleeding. Her S3 gets a -1 turn cooldown buff.\n",

      "description": "(8/3/2023 Update): Her passive now gives +20% CR push upon activation.\nLionheart Cermia is pretty much the AoE version of Fire Cermia, except that she cannot use her S3 right away. Her main strength lies in PvP, where she shines when enemy has dual attacks or counter attacks. As an ally gets hit, she will cleanse herself and gain fighting spirit and increases her own CR. Once she gets to 80 fighting spirit, she can use her defense penetration AoE attack. Do keep in mind that the cleanse only happens once very 3 turns, so do not expect her to keep cleansing against a debuff heavy team.\nShe isn;t a one-size-fits-all type of unit, where you can throw her into any team and call it a day. Lionheart Cermia has a few quirks that you need to work around ; such as being more defense-oriented and kind of held back if not taken against a team that;s heavy in counters and extra attacks. However, overall she;s still a really fun unit that people should play around with in PvP.\nBuild Notes\nWhen it comes to building Lionheart Cermia, there aren;t a lot of stats that you need to really focus on. She can be built like any other damage dealer; except for swapping out the focus on ATK for a focus on DEF. Her defense-based skillset can be a bit weird for a player to deal with when finding gear for her.\nThis does, however, mean that she can use all those strange gear pieces that you undoubtedly have at this point. These are those gears that are made for damage builds, but rolled way too many times into a DEF% substat. While the Speed build is one of the best choices for her, there are a few people that have used the Lifesteal build.\nA good goalpost for her stats looks to be something like:\n\n170-180 Speed\n2,000+ DEF (More is always better)\n100% Crit Chance\n250%+ Crit DMG%\n\nNot a lot of people use her with Immunity, as it would largely go wasted. This is due to her passive cleansing herself of all debuffs.\n",

She will always crit as long as she lands her attack. There is no need to build crit rate on her. That means most of her stats will go to attack, crit damage, speed defense and health. She doesn;t land debuffs either, so no need for effectiveness.\nHer key skill is her S3 that is a single target nuke, which gives herself vigor buff and gives all allies vigor buff if she is able to kill someone using it. Due to the ally;s vigor buff being conditional, she is not as reliable when it comes to this.\nHer passive will return an AoE attack if the enemy uses too many AoE attacks. Unlike Seaside Bellona, she doesn;t suffer from elemental disadvantage.\nShe also gets immunity on her skill 1, allowing her to get some debuff protection if you are not running an cleanser. Overall, she is not super overpowered and is quite balanced so far.\nAs for stats, you want to aim for a bruiser build:\n\n3k+ Attack\n1.2k+ Defense\n16k+ HP\n200+ Speed\n250%+ Crit DMG\n\nThis will make sure she can survive and deal some decent damage at the same time.\n",

      "description": "(Written day of Lucy;s release, 2/25/21)\nLucy has just been released, however it;s easy to see that she is going to be a good unit for newer players to use. She;s unique, in that she;s the first three-star unit to have the debuff Restrict. However, unlike units like Cerise and Captain Rikoris, Lucy has Restrict on her first skill too ; albeit it;s a small chance if not Soulburned.\nShe seems more like a budget Cerise instead of an actual Soul Weaver, as her s2 is basically Cerise;s s3, minus Invincibility. Her S3 is also nice, however it;s not considered to be a full cleanse, as it merely decreases debuff duration by 1 turn. In general, Lucy feels more like a Mage unit that got accidentally classed as a Soul Weaver, but can now use Soul Weaver artifacts, which could help her quite a bit.\nBuild Notes\nThere;s not a lot of information on Lucy yet, however it;s pretty easy to see where you;d want to invest your stats in.\nIn general, you;d want to build Lucy with bulk and Effectiveness ; More HP means she can survive for longer to apply more debuffs and have bigger shields, and Effectiveness means higher chances for debuffs. You;ll also want to put Lucy on Speed boots so she can get her turn quicker. As of right now, there;s no final-goal to aim for with Lucy, so do your best and apply as much HP%, Effectiveness%, and Speed on her as you can.\nIn the Utility Build, it is possible to swap out her HP% ring for Effectiveness% if you find yourself lacking Eff%. However, this leaves her very squishy and susceptible to being taken out in one hit, so it;s not recommended to do so unless you absolutely have to.\nIf you don;t have Celestine, The Guardian Star;s Blessing works alright in a pinch. However, Celestine;s infinitely better, and should replace TGSB as soon as possible.\n[2/17/2022 Update] ; S3 now has healing. S2 has -1 turn cooldown buff.\n",

As long as he doesn;t get invincibility buff stripped during the second turn, he will be able to pull off his AoE cleave like the old times.\nHis S1 can steal buffs, which is similar to the old version.

However, she is still usable in Wyvern, Raids and also PvP offensive teams.\nHer third skill has defense break and always attacks with elemental advantage. Her second skill is a passive that gives 20/30% crit chance + attack above 50% health, thus lowering the gear requirements for her to reach her full damage potential. You would only need 70% crit rate to get her to crit all the time, and 55% against water enemies if you maxed out her skill 2.\nHer first skill reduces her third skill cooldown, but at a random number of turns. It also has a bit of RNG and can hit for 70%, 140% and 210% of her attack power.\nThis best thing is that a dual attack reduces her cooldown even faster. Taranor Guard, Kitty Clarissa or Tamarinne can really make her shine even more.\nWith the emergence of stronger single target attackers, she has been mostly used for PvE content such as Wyvern. Her exclusive equipment doesn;t really do much for her considering the resources you are spending.\n",

The new changes makes it such that she can revive a teammate to 20% health when they die, giving them a chance to get a move.

The key is that he gains the vigor buff right from the start for 3 turns, giving him enough time to deal damage as long as he survives. The key is to build him bulky enough to not die from burst damage in 1 hit.\nHis damage output is now a bit better thanks to the change in passive (provides defense penetration), allowing him to counter attack when an ally also receives a critical hit. His skill 1 now provokes instead, which focuses damage on him when he successfully lands it when an ally is attacked.\nHis skill 3 remains unchanged and can deal AoE damage and inflict decrease defense while increasing his own attack. It is also important to have a team that can help him mitigate enough damage (Aurius, revive, barrier etc.) to ensure he survives any type of burst damage.\nAs for stats, you want enough health and defense:\n\n16k+ HP\n1500+ Defense\n250%+ Crit Damage\n150%+ Effect Resistance\n\nCrit rate is not necessary as he will have crit most of the time. However, it doesn;t hurt to have higher crit rate. Effect resistance is also a stat mostly for PvP and a gear check versus your opponents. Speed is also not required. Lifesteal set is also a key component in keeping him alive, as long as he is attacking.\n;\n",

And guess what; he;s better than ;actually decent; now! His HP% multipliers have been increased, it;s not absolutely necessary to put him on an Effect Resistance Build, his S3 offers more than just cleansing; he;s become a counter to the highly-oppressive (and quite frankly overloaded) Angel of Light Angelica, who;s seen heavy use these days.\nOne of the main downsides to him is that he;s a ML 5-star unit; because he;s already one of the rarest types of units in the game, not many people will have him for going up against AoL. On top of that, he was incredibly underwhelming in his first release, so not many people pulled for him. However, for those who are lucky enough to have him, he now makes for a great unit in PvP ; specifically, RTA against Angel of Light Angelica.\nBuild Notes\nSince his s3, when available, decreases debuff durations by 1 turn, he doesn;t need to be built with Effect Resistance any more. Some people have even started putting him in a damage bruiser build, too!\nIf you;re building him pure tank/cleanser, the optimal build stats for him would look to be about:\n\n26,000+ HP (More is always better)\n1,500 DEF\n250+ Speed\n\nIf you;re going for a more DPS build, though, your Mediator Kawerik stats should look to be about:\n\n21,000 HP (Again, more is always better)\n1,300 DEF\n220 Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n275% Crit Damage\n\n",

      "description": "(Written 12/20/21)\nMelany; isn;t really the best unit. She hasn;t gotten nearly as much attention as the rest of the 3* batch this update (that being Helen, Christy, Camilla and Penelope) and for good reason. Although she was officially the first character to have the Stigma debuff before Ran;s release, that;s all that Melany is good for. Melany suffers from having 3* stats, low ATK especially for a Warrior, and average multipliers at best.\nSomebody late-game who has enough good gear to make her usable will surely find someplace that she;s good in. However, as it stands right now, Melany can;t really be built to be useful for early-game, and there are 3-star units much better than her at her job. The only place she;s good in would be as a budget Ran; even then, Ran excels in everything else that Melany does, as he offers far more than just Stigma.\n",

      "description": "Melissa is a great addition to your squad if you need a strong single target DPS that can survive for a turn to dish out damage. She offers strong single target nuking power.\nHer S3 has elemental advantage and buff strip and therefore can be brought to fight water units. She also gains an extra turn if she lands a critical hit. If she lands her curse, she does even more damage, and curse also factor in ally damage as well.\nHaving 100% crit rate ensures you have an extra turn and can transition into using S2 for more extra damage and gain immortality for 1 turn. This combo is especially great at protecting her from any incoming damage, although not immune to debuffs. Her S1 also has unhealable and can also do more damage at lower health.\nFor PvE, she is great at golem and if you need a good nuker, she will do well there. For PvP, her kit is especially great against any strong DPS as she can transition for S3 to S2 to keep her safe for 1 turn. Also, as a mage, she can wield the Tagehel;s Ancient Book, allowing her or her teammates to soul burn right at the get go.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/16/21)\nAs of Mercedes; buffs, she;s rocketed herself up from ;warm-body until you get someone better in your team; to ;actually pretty good!; She can be powered up even further once you clear 10-10 of Episode 3, and will get her own exclusive artifact, made just for her, called Magic for Friends. You;ll have to clear the stage The Final Destination in order to power her up, though.\nWhen she;s powered-up, she;ll get a new buff called Immense Power. It increases her ATK by 15%, and will revive her with 50% HP after dying. Now, granted, this revive can only happen once per battle, but that;s still insane! Magic for Friends, her own exclusive artifact, decreases the damage she takes via a critical hit by 25%, and when she;s attacked without it being her turn (e.g. when the enemy attacks), she has a 15% chance every 2 turns to activate Dimensional Rupture, her s2, again.\nAs such, she;s managed to become a good unit to use in Guild Wars or other Arena fights! AoE counterattacking is all the rage right now, and as such the new Mercedes fits perfectly into this new meta!\nBuild Notes\nThese Build Notes will be assuming that your Mercedes is already powered up. There are three builds to use on powered-up Mercedes: the Counterattack Build, Speed Build, and the Lifesteal Build. Using the counterattack build would of course be the best choice, so she can increase her Combat Readiness more. However, the Speed build is easier on her stats, and Lifesteal can help sustain her a little more, since you;ll be using Magic for Friends as her artifact.\nThe Free ATK set from adventure is only to be used if your Meru isn;t powered up yet.\nA good Mercedes build looks to be about:\n\n11,000+ HP\n1,200 DEF\n190 Speed\n3,500 ATK (More is always better)\n100% Crit Rate\n280%+ Crit DMG\n\nIf you have her on the Speed Build, the ideal speed is about 210 or more.\nArtifact Note ; Magic for Friends is pretty much the only artifact to use on her after she;s been powered up. The other two artifact choices are for if your Mercedes isn;t powered up yet.\n",

      "description": "Midnight Gala Lilias is a strong limited edition assassin that is very well worth building, if you can get the right stats for her. Her main kit is her S3, where she can get up to 100% defense penetration as long as the enemy has 16k health more than her.\nThis makes her a tank killer and often don;t do good damage against other assassins or bruisers with lower health. Her passive will activate team attack buff + CR push as long as the enemy has less than 50% HP after her S3 attack, giving your team members a chance to move ahead of the enemy team. Aside from that, her passive also ensures she cannot be one shot by any direct attacks.\nHer S1 can heal herself based on her attack. With a counter set, she can trigger a few extra S1;s for bonus healing. Also, since she does not need any crit rate, she can focus other stats such as attack, health and critical damage.\nHere is a rough guide for her stats:\n\n4.5k+ Attack\n1k+ Defense\n8-9k Health\n300%+ Crit Damage\n110-250 Speed (depends on your build)\n\nIf you have standard DPS gear, these stats might be a bit hard to get since most pieces will have some crit rate somewhere.\n",

      "description": "(Written 11-18-21)\nNow that we;ve had a couple of weeks to test Milim, the verdict is out!\n;She;s shockingly underwhelming.\nEven with her Attack buff and unique buff Dragon Eye, which increases her Hit Chance and Evasion both by 20%, her damage is surprisingly not that great on her S3 or S2. Many people thought that Milim would be the Violet killer of the That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime collab, but that spot instead goes to her friend Rimuru.\nFor what it;s worth, though, Milim does have an interesting kit! Her passive completely removes Stealth off of all enemies if she has Dragon Eye on her, and can remove 10 Souls off of the enemy team with her s2;s extra attack (which consumes her Focus). Her s1 also buffs up her ATK for a turn, and can be soulburned for an extra turn. She;s still good in PvP, but she;s not going to be a meta-destroyer unit who singlehandedly wipes out our current meta; she can still get Evaded, even with her extra Hit Chance, so she;s not guaranteed safe.\nBuild Notes\nYou;ll want Milim fast, and with as much DPS stats as possible. A Counter/Immunity build does work on her (as it stacks up more Focus for her s2), but her best set will be either the General Speed Build or the Penetration Build.\nFor her Speed-based builds, you;ll want to aim for stats like:\n\n3,700+ ATK\n230+ Speed\n10,000~ HP\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit Damage\n\nFor her Counter build, it;s pretty similar to her Speed build, with a few differences:\n\n14,000 HP\n3,500+ ATK\n180~ Speed\n100% Crit Rate\n240% Crit Damage\n\nIt;ll be a bit harder to achieve her desired stats with Counter, since they don;t add any stat benefits to her.\n",

She will clear all debuffs from all allies on enemy extra turn and provide skill nullifier. Peira is the extra turn unit that will not be as effective due to the unbuffable debuff and restrict present.\nHer skill 3 will CR push everyone up and give them attack buff + barrier for 2 turns, which is really good to contest either turn 1 or 2, depending on your speed gear. Since her awakenings are effect resist, it is best to build her with very high effect resistance to avoid getting stunned. She has good base speed for a soul weaver (actually highest amongst them at the time of writing).\nHer skill 1 can be clutch and making an enemy lose a turn. As for where she is used, 99% of the time will be in PvP, primarily arena. In PvE, she can be used for the skill 3 attack buff and CR push, but the other skills are not as useful.\nWhen it comes to a build:\n\n10k+ HP\n1.2k+ DEF\n250+ Speed\n230%+ Effect Resistance\n\nOnce you are able to hit these baseline stats, she is hard to debuff and can often contest turn 1 or 2 depending on your PvP rank and gear.\n",

      "description": "(8/3/2023 Update): Passive has 100% sacred blessing proc chance when maxed.\nWell, it;s been about two weeks since Mort was buffed, and the current consensus on him is: the buffs sure are better than nothing. Mort used to be absolutely bottom-barrel tier, often called ;The Great Memetelix; more than anything else and never saw any real use.\nNow, though, he does his job better of being a counterattacking bruiser-type unit. He;s gotten better at his role; although Mort is still not top-tier yet, he does have a spot in PvP. However, he does get countered by the current meta of counterattacking units, such as Rem or Violet. He doesn;t have any PvE use still, though. All in all, Mort isn;t a game-breaking or meta-defining unit, but for now he does have some use.\nBuild Notes\nWhen you;re building Mort, putting him on the Counter Bruiser Build is the best choice for him, as he;ll be able to counterattack even more, along with being able to activate his passive on his counters. As such, this makes him an immediate candidate for Elbris Ritual Sword, for even more counter chance. However, if you don;t have the gear quality necessary to pull off a good Mort build on Counter, the Fast Bruiser Build will work for him.\nImmunity is still necessary on him. Even though he can;t get stunned or put to sleep, he;s still vulnerable to a myriad of debuffs that would limit or neutralize him.\nA good Mort build looks to be about:\n\n20,000 HP\n1,400 Defense\n200+ Speed\n100% Crit Rate (absolutely necessary)\n270%+ Crit Damage (290%+ optimal)\n\nFor his Exclusive Equipment, any of the three choices work on him. None of them are the absolute best choices, though, so it entirely depends on what you need out of Mort.\nThe Lifesteal Build is a bit of a joke build, but it;s still somewhat viable for him.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 7-20-22)\nMuwi is a very strong unit, especially for a 3 star. Ever since his release in early January, he;s quickly rocketed to fame for being an easy-to-use unit that meshes so well with the Wyvern Hunts ; the first Hunt that every new player should strive to build a team for. Muwi is easily obtainable and very strong, which makes him a perfect choice for anyone looking to break into Wyvern 13.\nHe has pretty much everything that a player needs for Wyvern ; Bleed for multiple debuffs (2+ debuffs on W13 forces the boss to only target the frontline), Combat Readiness increase in an all-Ice team to lower gear requirements, Defense Break in case the boss resists Furious;s debuffs, and Attack Break to lower the boss;s damage. His kit was practically made for Wyvern 13, and it shows.\nBuild Notes\nMuwi is surprisingly easy to gear. A newer player can use the Free ATK Set build at first ; which is, quite literally, the ATK Set that they get from the Adventurer;s Path at the beginning of the game. After that, once a player is later on in the game and has gathered up some better gear, they can make the switch to the High Damage W13 build.\nThe ideal stats for Muwi is going to look something like this:\n\n35% Crit Chance\n65% Effectiveness\n138 Speed\nAs much ATK as possible\nAs much Crit DMG as possible\n\nThese stats are extremely easy to get (with maybe the exception of the Effectiveness%, however a player can get a ring with EFF% as the main stat to fix that). 35% Crit Chance is because Furious will constantly provide the extra 50% via his S2, and Ice units get a 15% Crit Chance Bonus against the Wyvern.\nWhen it comes to Artifacts, there is no better option than Daydream Joker. Although there are other artifacts that work fine on Muwi (such as Dust Devil or Torn Sleeve), there;s no real reason to give him anything other than Daydream Joker, due to the nature of it being such a good artifact to boost his damage.\n",

Most debuffers will suffer from the 15% miss rate and hence a bit unreliable at times if you want guaranteed victory in certain matchups.\nThankfully, her S3 has a soul burn which ensures she dispels all enemy buffs and inflicts skill increase cooldown and disabling their trigger attacks. This means, as long as she doesn;t miss on ice units, she is guaranteed to delay the enemy team for 1 turn. This is plenty of time to dispose most teams in PvP as long as you can go first.\nShe can then also follow up with her S2 or S1 for seal or silence. There is RNG involved here due to the 15% miss rate on debuffs. As long as they land, you would have full control on the enemy team.\nShe will need a good team that includes a team attack buffer, tagahel mage user and a DPS that can help clean up the opposing team once she lands her S3.\nBuild wise, she can be versatile, aiming for either high attack or high effectiveness alongside speed depending on the build.\nFor DPS:\n\n2.8k+ Attack\n900+ Defense\n8k+ Health\n95%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n200+ Speed\n20%+ Effectiveness\n\nFor Debuffer:\n\nAny Attack\n1k+ Defense\n10k+ Health\n200+ Speed\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\n",

Her own attack starts to increase over time as she takes more turns.\nHer skill 3 increases her own attack and stuns all enemies with some defense penetration. As long as the enemy doesn;t have immunity, this skill can wrack havoc on the entire enemy team.\nWith a counter set, she can rely on some RNG to dish out extra damage and some healing for herself via her skill 1.

Without it, she will be less effective as her passive takes longer to activate. Since she is not a pure healer, you may need to bring another healer in tougher situations. She works best with bruisers that can withstand attacks in PvP mode (Arena and GW).\nStats wise, you want:\n\n1.2k+ DEF\n16k+ HP\n160+ Speed\n200%+ Effect Resistance\n\nShe won;t need other stats as she won;t be dealing damage. However, getting as high defense, health and effect resistance will be good for her.

She;s not going to destroy any metas and shape it solely to counter her, mind you, but she;s got an interesting kit that can output some pretty nice damage (especially for a 3 star unit). Her main gimmick is the defense penetration on her s3, which scales higher and higher depending on her speed.\nHer s3 is topped off really well by her passive. Basically, if she has perception after attacking, she will be able to trigger an extra attack with the same skill she just used ; meaning that there is a very real chance of being able to trigger her s3 twice in a row. The only downfalls to her is that she needs to have the higher speed, and her base ATK is pretty low.\nOverall, Orte is a pretty fun PvP unit, but she isn;t going to be a must-have unit or anything.\nBuild Notes\nOrte needs to have Speed. There is no other four-set to use on her except for Speed, it;s just that simple. As for her two-set, there are people who have used Crit Rate or Immunity, but the best choice is, by far, Penetration. This way, even if she only gains 30% Penetration, that;s still an extra 15% added to that base 30%.\nGenerally, you;ll want your Orte to look like this:\n\n290+ Speed (300+ is ideal)\n3,000+ ATK\n85%+ Crit Rate (though 100% would be ideal)\n250%+ Crit DMG\n\n",

She essentially makes Cerise all but useless; doing the job of Restricting, making targets unable to be buffed, and decreasing buff durations by a turn in her s2. However, that;s not all: her second skill grants an extra turn, allowing her to chain it into her s3.\nHer s3 is where things start to really get interesting. Thanks to her unique buff of Escort, AoE Attack buff, combining with her rather beefy shield, Peira can not only weaken the enemies while strengthening her allies and making herself into a safety net for them (on top of giving herself Stealth, so single-target enemies can;t attack her).\nShe makes for a very strong opener in all sorts of PvP, that being Arena, GW and RTA. Of course, though, she really has a high gear requirement, as it;s pretty much necessary for her to go first before anyone else. She;s not the unit for newer players to use.\nBuild Notes\nAll that a player needs on Peira is Speed. Speed is her essential stat, and everything else is a lower priority. However, that doesn;t mean you can skimp out on, say, Effectiveness%. While Speed is the main stat you need to focus on, she still needs to have some Effectiveness, HP% and DEF% to fully complete the build.\nAlthough in the General Speed Build a Hit set is recommended, you can really use just about anything as her two-set, as long as the Speed substats are good. You could even use a broken set if the stats are good enough.\nThe ideal late-game Peira build ; the build that should be used as a goalpost ; looks something like:\n\n300 Speed (Any extra is always better; some people have even hit 310+)\n14,000~ HP\n1,000 DEF\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\nThis a very high bar to achieve, and a lot of people won;t even come close for a while.\n",

      "description": "Note (10/27/2022): She does not deal critical damage anymore and her S3 gets a 3 turn attack buff with a slight CR increase.\nHer primary role in the game is being a heavy debuffer with burn and bomb on S3 and detonate the next turn. The downside is there is a 15% RNG element that you will miss regardless of how much effectiveness your ML Flan has, making it less reliable than pure damage dealers.\nHer main combo works like this. Open with S3 for the burn and bomb, which gives her an attack buff, thus activating her S2 passive. This gives her a total of 65% combat readiness boost, allowing her to cut in for another turn on enemies slower than her. Then, she follows up with S1 to detonate the burn and bomb. Soul burn allows you to target another unit.\nA large problem with Pirate Captain Flan is that, in theory, she;s really good. However, she has a lot of hoops to jump through in order to work right. As such, she ends up becoming a niche unit that really needs heavy setup and not a lot of players will ever be able to gain the opportunity to use her.\nBuild Notes\nShe needs Speed, ATK% and Effectiveness% in order to work well. As such, the only build for her to use is the General Speed Build. It;s been figured out that a good goalpost for Pirate Captain Flan;s stats looks to be something like:\n\n4,500+ ATK (More is better)\n250+ Speed\n12,000 HP\n1,000~ DEF\n100%+ Effectiveness (150%+ is highly recommended)\n\n",

Because her passive decreases the amount of Combat Readiness everyone in the enemy team receives by 50%, Auxiliary Lots, Flan, even Arbiter Vildred will be affected by her!\nBuild Notes\nIdeally, when building her for countering CR-heavy teams, you;ll want to make sure she;s about 230~ speed, and that she;s beefy enough to take a few hits from the enemy team. You can keep her at around 150% Effectiveness as well, so she lands her buffs. These are not stats that beginners can achieve, as she;s a PVP-heavy unit.\nNote: You can go with either a Defense% or Hp% ring for her in the suggested build. Using an Effectiveness% ring would get her to 150%+ Effectiveness easily, but leaves her very squishy. It;s not recommended to build her if you can only afford either tankiness or Eff%, but if you choose to build her anyway, you could sacrifice Effectiveness if you don;t have the resources for both.\n",

Will be great in Banshee and also dealing with water damage dealers.\nAs a full on support healer, Ray comes with cleansing and team AoE healing as his biggest strengths. His skill one cleanses 1 debuff of an ally or himself, which is similar to Elena.\nHis skill 2 heals and gives a barrier to all allies. The thing is that his heal scales off the ally health, so he would do better when healing high health members. He won;t be as effective healing squishy targets, but the barrier makes up for it.\nHis skill 3 gives team cleanse, debuff immunity and healing off ally health. Similar to skill 2, it benefits tanks/bruisers more than DPS units. There is also the option to soul burn, giving more healing in tough situations.\nHaving some form of protection is recommended when using Ray alongside other allies.

      "description": "(Updated 9/10/21)\nAs it stands, Rem is considered to be another counterattacking bruiser in the meta. Now, that;s not bad or anything, not at all; in fact, right now Rem is absolutely game-breaking. Right now, she does have a good place in the Researcher Carrot and buff-heavy meta we;re in ; due to her unique buff, Demon Mode, which makes her immune to all debuffs and ignores Effect Resistance, she counters Researcher Carrot pretty hard. Plus, with the part of her passive that makes her AoE counterattack take priority over a basic attack when she counters makes her perfect for ; well, a Counter set.\nPeople have used Rem in PvE (namely, Wyvern 13) before, due to her semi-reliable buffs and Defense Break on her s1, including the fact that she ignores Effect Resistance on Demon Mode. However, she shines most in PVP, and some would say not to use Rem in Wyvern 13 at all, as there are better choices (e.g. Sigret, Seaside Bellona, Alexa, etc). It;s still worth noting that she can be used there, though.\nBuild Notes\nRem doesn;t need Immunity nearly as bad as most other Counter units, due to Demon Mode essentially being a 2-turn Immunity built in. The Counterattacking Build is a given, due to her AoE attack taking priority over her s1 for counters. However, the General Speed Build is more or less for if you don;t have the gear quality to achieve a good Rem build with Counter, as most units in the game can always benefit with a Speed set.\nIt;s best to replace her Speed set with Counter as soon as you can, though, because the extra chances to activate Iron Strike will be greatly appreciated by you.\nA good Rem build looks to be about:\n\n3,500+ ATK\n1,200~ Defense\n15,000-17,000 HP\n100% Crit Rate\n250%-300%+ Crit Damage\n150+ Speed\n\nRem is rather stat-hungry, so it might be difficult to get her to the ideal Rem build. If she;s on a Speed build, you can expect to see about 170 Speed instead of 150.\n",

      "description": "Note (10/27/2022): S3 gets 3 turn attack and S1 now gets soul burn for extra turn.\nRemnant Violet is a good all round single target DPS. Think of him as the dark version of Cermia but with more defensive capabilities than offense.\nDue to his passive skill 2, which gives him the evasion buff when he moves and when ending his turn, it is encouraged to build him fast to take advantage of it. Evasion allows him to survive, which in turn allows him to unleash his skill 3, which ignores 50% defense on top of a free attack buff. Like Cermia, it is not necessary to bring an attack buffer, which makes them shine in Guild Wars.\nEach time he attacks or evades, he gains 1 focus. Upon getting 5 focus, he will automatically use his skill 3 on a random enemy. Having a counter set on him is really good at getting focus stacks, especially against AoE teams. Having Assassin Cartuja with him + ML Dreamblade means he is getting 85% evasion.\nHe does have his weaknesses, such as dying to attacks when he fails to evade due to low health. He also gets countered by F Kluri or Dizzy S3 and Melissa (with Oath Key) as they are able to strip his evasion buff, rendering him vulnerable.\n",

Her damage scales of her attack, but she cannot crit.\nHer skill 3 has a long cooldown, but can be reduced quickly by cycling through utilizing her passive with units such as Zio who is fast. Since her passive grants her 1 extra turn (when max skilled), she can get 2 turns very quickly as long as the fastest unit keeps getting his/her turn.\nIf you choose to use Etica;s Scepter, she can cycle her skill 3 even faster, allowing her to spam it soon enough. However, her skill 3 AoE damage is quite low (though ignores defense), but it can also increase their skill cooldown and reduce their combat readiness. It is more of a utility skill.\nHer skill 1 can defense break, which helps a bit in increasing the damage of your allies. All in all, she is an okay support but nothing spectacular. She works alright in PvP and actually useful in PvE as well. That is the bonus side of her.\nStats wise, you want something like this:\n\n4k+ Attack\n1.5k+ Defense\n15k+ HP\n50%+ Effectiveness\n\nSpeed is not necessary for her thanks to her passive.\n",

      "description": "(Written 11/13/21)\nNow that we;ve had a few weeks to run some tests, it turns out that Rimuru is disgustingly OP. They;re solidly about as strong as Rem, and we all know how busted she is. It was prophesized that Milim was going to be the Violet-killer of this meta, but as it turns out, Rimuru was the one to do so. This is mainly because of their S3, ;Devour it, Black Flame!;, which not only is unaffected by elemental disadvantage, but will have at least 5,000 extra fixed damage at the end of the attack. However, depending on the amount of buffs on your ally team, that extra damage can go up to 10,000.\nIt;s been figured out that you need 8 buffs in total for the full 10,000 damage ; note that this actually isn;t that hard to do at all! You;d only need 2 buffs on each unit in order to get the full 10,000 (e.g. using Sinful Angelica;s s3 with an Immunity Rimuru would be enough for 10,000 damage). On top of that, Rimuru copies 2 buffs after using a non-basic skill and applies it to all allies; if you trigger their S2;s attack, they;ll copy buffs off of the enemy, put it on allies, and then be able to use their S3. 10,000 damage is actually a lot; with the raw damage that their S3 puts in before the fixed damage, the full attack can easily be enough to take out or severely weaken DPS units, like Violet.\nLet;s not forget that, if the enemy they attack with their s3 is buffed, they;ll also break the defenses of the rest of the enemy team!\nOne downside to this is that the fixed damage increase only works with buffs there at the start of the turn. In other words, you can;t use Rimuru;s s3, copy buffs with it, and then get the 10,000 damage. You;ll have to wait until everyone has 2 buffs before you can get the full 10k.\nBuild Notes\nYou don;t want to build Rimuru as a tank unit with no damage! Even though there;s at least 5,000 guaranteed damage on their S3, you;ll still want to build them with damage to ensure there;s enough to burst down DPS units. However, having some bulk in them is still recommended, so they don;t immediately die. Effectiveness isn;t necessary, because their s3 isn;t affected by elemental disadvantage and their s2 always copies buffs regardless if the attack hits or not.\nA good Rimuru build looks to be about:\n\n3,600+ ATK\n220 Speed\n13,000~ HP\n1,200~ DEF\n100% Crit Rate\n270%+ Crit Damage\n\n",

While she may not be completely necessary, she does offer a very strong utility in damage reduction for the front line tank. This effectively allows you to bring 1 tank/healer and 3 other units that focus on DPS or debuffs.\nHer skill 1 provides target debuff, allowing all your other units to hit for more damage. Her skill 3 also does decent damage, although the combat readiness decrease isn;t helpful in Wyvern, it definitely helps you control a key target, alongside with an immunity buff and buff dispel to boot. Her own special buff, exploiting weak points, is also a great damage enhancer for her and the frontliner.\nFor PvP, it is best to use a bruiser or unit that can tank or heal hits and return damage effectively as the front line. She can be built with full offense or full hp support if you don;t have good gear.\nHere are some stat baseline you can aim for:\n\n2.8k+ Attack\n1.1k+ Defense\n9k+ Health\n200+ Speed\n85%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n65% Effectiveness\n\nThis will be sufficient as the DPS for Wyvern alongside applying target debuff.\n;\n",

Also, it increases combat readiness of your allies + herself when that happens. When equipped with Touch of Rekos, the healing can be very good, especially against AoE counters from Seaside Bellona. She is definitely a must pull for any users who have trouble dealing with Seaside Bellona.\nHer barrier + revive buff on S3 is a safety skill that helps in both PvE and PvP content. The downside is that your unit cannot be revived after they are dead, so make sure to have the revive buff up if you know one of your units is in danger of dying within the next 2 turns.

Roy;s passive doesn;t allow him to die in one hit, much similar to Tempest Surin;s passive. Do keep in mind that any 2 hit attacks can still kill him, like Uberious Tooth. He does have the Flame Alchemist special buff which gives him +20% attack and increased hit rate. However, it can be dispelled by ice element type opponents, much like the lore in the anime.\nDue to this, he is not recommended to fight against AoE ice attackers for a matter of fact. He is using the fighting spirit system, so he also cannot use his skill 3 right away, which is a strong AoE attack that hits pretty hard. His skill 1 can penetrate defense if the Flame Alchemist buff is present, which is super useful. When you soul burn skill 1, he gains an extra turn, allowing him to do more damage and then utilize his skill 3 AoE attack after.\nDue to his unique skill kit, he needs Tagahel;s to be efficient. Since he is a mage, he can wield it, but it is also nice to bring another mage so he can use more offensive artifacts. Belian is a total counter to his DPS, due to having no souls.\nAs for builds, he is best in standard DPS build with low health:\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n1k+ Defense\n9k+ HP\n110-200+ Speed\n\nHe is pretty easy to build due to his passive.\n",

Her passive when maxed gives her 50% evasion and if you stack it with any of the evasion artifacts like Double Edge Decrescent, Moonlight Dreamblade or Violet;s Talisman, she will have 70% evasion. Too bad her passive only allows her to counter attack every other turn, otherwise she would be just like a 5 star unit. However, her counter attack is AoE, so it does make it somewhat too OP.\nHer skill 1 can apply unable to be buff debuff, which is handy against buff heavy units.\nHer skill 3 grants team invincibility and can deal decent single target damage that penetrates defense, at the cost of high skill cooldown. Overall, she is useful in both PvE and PvP content thanks to a versatile kit. In PvP, she can deal with trouble units like ML Ravi and Arbitur Vildred thanks to her evasion.\nLike most evasion units, she is weak against non crit units like Arunka or even Hwayoung. Also, she can be squishy since she will be mostly built with damage. Having a tank to protect her is a good choice.\nStats wise:\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n1k+ Defense\n90%+ Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n150+Speed\nAny effectiveness is a bonus\n\n",

She is a hybrid attacker with utility and takes reduced damage at the expense of an ally(frontline) and is able to gain focus stacks to unleash an AoE defense break after allies (or herself) are attacked 5 times. This is even better if there are AoE attackers. Each AoE attack against your team of 4 will give SS Bellona 4 stacks of focus.\nShe can be built either as a full DPS or a sustain DPS type. If you need a strong Wyvern or Azimanak attacker, she fits the bill for both since her kit provides debuffs and AoE attacks.  She is also a great Labyrinth ally since she has very high moral points for most chats.\nShe is best paired with a tank or tank healer in the front so her damage is shared between them. Building her as a sustain DPS is viable since she can survive some damage as long as you get her enough health and defense.\nHer and Charles (Elbris) are really good as well due to their counter mechanics.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 04/08/22)\nNew changes makes her more viable than before.\nSenya is an interesting unit. She has the highest Attack in the game by far (even more ATK than Gunther, the previous highest-ATK unit), and can;t trigger a Critical Hit. However, she also has a 50% chance when skilled up to not have a Critical Hit land on her, at which point she not only deals extra damage on whoever did that to her, but also buffs up her allies. She can also counterattack once using her s3 and provoke as well. Her passive is also more reliable now, giving barrier to allies and also speed buff to herself.\nShe seems like a unit that;s at her best in PVP, since in PVE a lot of enemies you face don;t really lean into the whole Critical Hit aspect. In which case, if you want to take her into PVP, a viable strategy would probably include bringing a unit who can increase Critical Hit Resistance (e.g. Choux, Diene, etc.), for the full Crit Resistance.\nBuild Notes\nYou;ll want to be building Senya with ATK% and Speed at the priority, but remember to put some HP% and DEF% into her. You want the enemies to attack her, and she can;t do her job if she;s dead, remember that. Effectiveness isn;t really a big issue for her, since DPS units don;t build Resistance, but if you have any leftover stats, you can focus on her Effectiveness. Effect Resistance is a pretty good stat to put on her too, so she;s not debuffed like mad.\nA good Senya build is considered to be about:\n\n17,500 HP\n4,500+ ATK\n1,400 DEF\n170-200 Speed\n100%+ Resistance\n\nFor her unique equipment, option 2 for added barrier strength is a decent choice. For more damage, option 3 is better since it gives her greater attack buff.\n",

The additional attack is now on skill 1, with skill 2 passive preventing him from getting 1 shot. However, he can still die in 1 hit from artifacts like Rocket Punch or Uberious Tooth.\nHis skill 3 is a single target attack that hits hard and deals after effect damage on other enemies around the target. Any enemy killed by this attack cannot be revived.\nHowever, he does still need good damage gear to make sure he performs and is able to kill a unit.\nFor a built, you want:\n\n4k+ Attack\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit DMG\n150+ Speed\n\nAny effectiveness and health are a bonus for him.\n",

      "description": "(Written 11/26/21)\nNow that we;ve had some time to test out Shadow Knight Pyllis, the consensus is that she does her job a lot better, and fills in more roles too! Pyllis has always been an extremely high-defense bruiser unit, who specializes in Provoking and; well, defense-oriented content. With her specialty change and rune tree, she;s become much better at this job!\nShe kept her old ;gains more defense whenever she;s hit; part of her passive, and increases the defense of her allies for every fourth hit she takes. However, the real benefits mostly come from her s3, Perceptive Slash (that doesn;t mean the rest of her kit isn;t useful ; quite the opposite, actually), which removes a debuff from all allies before attacking her chosen enemy, Provoking them for a turn and granting a barrier on her allies for 2 turns, proportionate to her defense.\nWhen you max out her skill tree, Perceptive Slash will gain a 45% increased Hit Chance rate, and she;ll gain an extra 30% Hit Chance in general. This means Perceptive Slash has a shocking 75% Hit Rate! Pair it up with A Symbol of Unity or Oath Key, and we;re looking at a 95% chance to land Perceptive Slash! This is incredibly useful in the meta of heavy-Evade units (such as Violet), as it can help target particularly pesky units and make them focus on Pyllis herself. Overall, Shadow Knight Pyllis has a nice spot in the meta as of this writing, and it;s worth doing her Specialty Change if you;re in late-game arena and struggling with Evasion units.\nBuild Notes\nUnsurprisingly, you want Pyllis tanky. As much DEF% as possible would be optimal build for her, but you also want to make sure that she has HP% and SPD in her build as well. Using a Counter/Immunity build would be one of the best ideas for Pyllis (since she has Provoke and extra Hit Chance on her s1), but if you find yourself struggling with acquiring the ideal Pyllis build you can go for Speed/Immunity.\nAn ideal Pyllis build looks to be about:\n\n1,700+ Defense (If you can stack any more DEF than that, that would be ideal)\n18,000+ HP\n170+ Speed\n85%~ Effectiveness\n150%+ Effect Resistance\n\nRemember: the more Defense she has, the better!\n",

(Increase Critical Hit Chance and Continuous Healing are removed)\n(Written 7-28-22)\nNow that we;ve had a week or so to test Sharun out, her kit is just about what you would expect. She;s a Soul Weaver who seems more oriented towards being a Mage than anything else. However, she does have the unique Venom debuff to offer, which can be rather interesting to play around with.\nHer kit is made to be more of a PvP setup than anything else. She provides a myriad of debuffs to be used against the enemy team, especially with the Venom debuff. On top of this, the random buffs she provides in her passive are really good to use with DPS units. The only problem is that these buffs are randomized, so there;s no way to guarantee, say, an Attack buff on your DPS unit.\nBuild Notes\nSurprisingly, there are two ways to build Sharun. One of these ways is a General Speed Build, but the other way is a Counter Build. The Counter Build actually does work on her, due to her increasing the cooldown of anyone she hits that has Venom on them.\nYou;ll want your Speed Sharun to look like this:\n\n17,000 HP\n1,700 DEF\n220+ Speed\n100%+ Effectiveness (More is always better)\n\nIf you can, stack some Effect Resistance into her, but it;s not necessary.\nThe Counter Sharun should look something like this:\n\n15,000+ HP\n1,500+ DEF\n200+ Speed\n90%+ Effectiveness (Again, more is always better)\n\n",

      "description": "[4/27 2023 Update] No longer uses Focus and S3 now can also decrease attack of enemy. S1 can heallall allies.\n[Outdated] Well, Shuna;s been released, and; she;s underwhelming. There are two glaring problems with her skillset: firstly, her skillset doesn;t have any outright healing in her kit. Her s1 can help sustain herself, and her s2 balances out everyone;s HP (so this way one unit isn;t being singled out and left at 5% HP while everyone else is at 90% or higher), and her S3 is a whole other topic we;ll have to get into in a moment. However, there;s no skill of hers that actually heals her allies.\nThis already sets up a massive problem in Shuna: without any form of actual healing in her kit, she;s outshined by units who do what her first 2 skills do but better (Emilia, Ray, Maid Chloe, etc.). You;d need to use artifacts as a source of healing for her kit, such as Celestine or Unfading Memories. Even Sinful Angelica and Blaze Dingo ; two ;unconventional; Soul Weavers ; have some form of healing built in their kits: Singie heals if enemies die while she;s immortal, and Blingo heals based off of the damage he deals.\nThe meat of the problem lies within her s3, Sleep Spell. It takes at least 3 turns to charge up for (S2 -; S1 -; S1 to get 5 Focus), removes 2 buffs off of all enemies, and; puts them to Sleep for 2 turns. It;s worth noting that Shuna doesn;t even have a 100% chance to put her enemies after full skillups ; if you fully skill up her s3, she still only has a 75% chance max to put them to Sleep. Not only is her s3 underwhelming, takes 3 turns to charge up for, but it doesn;t even fit for a Soul Weaver;s kit.\nIn other words: Shuna can work in a pinch if she;s your only Soul Weaver, but honestly there are far better units who do her job way better. Montmorancy and Angelica are available via Connections, and they outperform her in healing, debuff dispel, and overall general support.\nBuild Notes\nNot a lot of people are going to build Shuna, but in case you do, a General Speed Build can work fine for her. Some people have used the Counter Build for her (for more self-support), but it does require a lot higher gear requirements.\nA good-looking Shuna build is about:\n\n18,000 HP\n1,500 DEF\n210+ Speed (200~ will be fine on the Counter Build)\n150%+ Effect Resistance\n70%+ Effectiveness\n\n",

      "description": "Update 14/4/2022: With the new changes, her passive is a bit similar like Eda, except that it pushes her up when any of your characters uses an AoE attack. So any AoE starter like Peira, Aux Lots, Ran etc. would work well here. You will just have to gear her a bit slower than your starters and she will most likely go after them.\nHer S3 is still does the same thing, but now pushes back the CR of the enemy that is going next. That makes her a big disrupter and is quite useful in control and cleave teams. Her S1 can now be soul burned to ignore effect resistance.\nOverall, her change is good and now is usable again in control or cleave teams. Pair her with fire Aramintha, Researcher Carrot or Seaside Iseria for some debuff fun times.\nOld Description: A unit born for PvP. She is very strong in offense against teams with no immunity or cleanse.\nYou will definitely want speed and immunity set on her to make sure she can get her attack off without dying. The 100% stun chance is nice. You will almost land on at least half the team even when RNG doesn;t go in your favor.\nML Sez is a great team mate with her. However, these 2 units are hard to pull.\n",

The main play is around using her S3 immortality to perform dual attacks, prevent revives and cleanse 1 debuff for the team.\nShe is best used manually in offense in both PvE and PvP.  Make sure to pair her with a strong attacker and utilize her immortality against revive units like Ruele, Roana or Maid Chloe. Since she also provides speed buff and attack buff, you will be able to get your turns faster.\nIn Guild Wars, she can be used as the utility support alongside a raw healer/tank with an offensive DPS.

Mr Chad Sol Badguy is a strong single target DPS with the ability to deal percentage health damage to an enemy. With both his second and third skill scaling % health damage, he can deal ridiculous amounts of damage without having to build too much attack.\nHe shines in any content when the enemy has high hp. This includes Raid bosses, Abyss Floors, Golem + Wyvern 10 and below. For any new player, having him will help you through some of the tougher PvE content. If he is build fast, he gets more turns and also build up fighting spirit faster.\nThe best part about him is his ability to strip an enemy;s buff and apply anti-buff debuff. With his constant extra turn mechanic vs opponents, he can get his third skill back up pretty quickly.\nI recommend him to any new player who is lacking a strong single target DPS and do not want to go through the Commander Lorina specialty change grind.\n",

She;s going to end up completely shutting down SSB teams, since a huge part of her kit is her Focus-based passive.\nMore testing will be done before we say for sure, though.\nBuild Notes\nThere;s no one-size-fits-all build for her yet, but you can usually play it safe with the general speed build of Speed/Immunity. Since Solitaria is solely a tanky debuffer, you can just build her with HP%, DEF%, and Speed. Effectiveness% is a nice touch, but not necessary, since a lot of SSBs don;t really have Resistance.\nBuff Update [2/17/2022] ; She gets barrier on S3, stealth and daydream buff on S2.

For PvE, she is useful in Raids as now she cannot be targeted by single attacks unless she is the last one standing.\nShe gains bonus attack damage (up to 50%) when anyone dies (both ally or enemy). This works in Raid as the bonus carries over and does not reset. She also deals a lot more damage on her skill 3 based on the number of debuffs on the enemy. If someone dies to her skill 3, every enemy team member loses 50% combat readiness. In Abyss, you can run her with 3 support/healers due to her being neutral element and has poison, the most OP debuff on many Abyss floors.\nIn PvP, while she may be vulnerable to AoE attackers, but you can mitigate that by using healers. She can now hit very hard as long as you land debuffs on any enemy, especially defense break. Her damage will also increase as characters die.\nAlso, her skill 1 now cannot be counter attacked and can hit 2 enemies when skill 3 is on cooldown, so she becomes much stronger on offense as she can;t be targeted by RNG counter attacks.\n",

However, Maid Chloe is still considered to be better, if you just want to use either one of them for their AoE revive skills.\nApart from their s3s, though, Maid Chloe and Spirit Eye Celine are pretty different. ML Celine offers mostly damage and counter-attacking (along with some self-sustain), and the AoE revive part of her skillset is just a bit of a bonus. Her passive is similar to Tempest Surin;s, in that you can;t just one-shot her with a nuker and be done with it ; although, Rimuru;s extra damage mechanic on their S3 can burst through her passive.\nThe main problem with her skillset is that she;s reliant on a lot of things. Her s3;s cooldown is long (but that is mitigated by her passive decreasing her s3;s cooldown by a turn whenever anyone on the battlefield dies), and relies on all of her allies being dead in order to be able to use it to its fullest. On top of that, Rimuru all but laughs in her face, by copying her allies; Immortality and going through her ;can;t take a certain amount of damage; passive.\nIn short: Although Spirit Eye Celine does have many things going for her, there are more units that have a lot more usability in more situations, not to mention that Rimuru can counter her with ease.\nBuild Notes\nMany people have built Spirit Eye Celine with Lifesteal, in order to help her sustain herself, but the General Speed Build can help ease up some of the Speed requirements a bit. Many people have also put her on Penetration as well, as it;ll help add more damage to her upgraded version of her s1, along with the basic version of her s1, as well.\nA good ML Celine build looks to be about:\n\n3,500+ ATK\n9,000~ HP\n900~ DEF\n100% Crit Rate\n270%+ Crit Damage\n\n",

However, he is weak to bruisers, like Senya; Straze;s kind of squishy, so it;s not hard for him to get controlled, even with his Invincibility.\nIn PvE, he becomes a boss one-shotting unit. Straze is very high in gear requirements when it comes to being a boss-killer, though. If you get him good enough gear, though, he can actually destroy bosses like Wyvern 13, Banshee 13, Azimanik 13, etc. He;s one of those units where he needs a team built around him (similarly to Inferno Khawazu), instead of slotting him in somewhere and hoping for the best.\nBuild Notes\nStraze needs high ATK. He needs all of the typical DPS stats (ATK%, Speed, Crit Damage%, Crit Rate%) that you can think of, but especially ATK, to make sure that his S3 and S2 are at their highest potential. He can use either the Speed Build or the Destruction Build.\nStraze stats should look something like:\n\n4,000+ ATK (can ideally be higher, but 4k is the minimum)\n200+ Speed (240+ with the Speed Build)\n100% Crit Rate\n250%+ Crit Damage\n\nAs mentioned, he;s very high in gear requirements, but it is worth it in the end.\n",

      "description": "[6/8/23 Patch]: S3 now cleanses and can penetrate enemy defense. Her S2 passive now gives crit rate buff.\nWith the new Summer Break Charlotte, she is now a very strong attacker with good utility. She can be used as a single target DPS with some AoE thrown in if she is called to dual attack. Her passive gives crit rate buff, so now that lowers the gear requirements for crit rate and can be built with more crit damage or health, depending on whether you want her to be a bruiser or not.\nHer S1 still can defense break as usual. The biggest change is her S3, where it now penetrates defense on top of cleansing her own debuffs + give speed buff to all allies. This makes her very good in speed cleave teams due to the change. She can one shot many units (if built full damage) thanks to the defense penetration.\nSince her passive grants her enhanced dual attack, she will be called often for a dual attack, activating many AoE attacks along the way. This makes her strong in PvP in longer battles.\nStat wise:\n\n3k+ Attack\n1k+ Defense\n9k+ HP\n100% Crit Rate\n300%+ Crit DMG\n180+ Speed\nAny effectiveness\n\nWith this setup, you can deal good damage over time. For a bruiser build, you will want to drop some crit dmg or attack for more health and defense.\n",

      "description": "(Updated 9/9/21)\nNow that we;ve had a few weeks to test her out, the consensus on Summertime Iseria is that she;s; difficult. She;s reliant on way too many things ; being drafted in the right team, the not-100% chance to dispel buffs on her s1, basically needing Star of the Deep Sea at +30 to ensure that she can constantly lands bombs, the fact her bombs on her passive are randomized and rely on the Effectiveness/Resistance check; the list goes on and on.\nSummertime Iseria is made for PVP, but relies pretty heavily on everything mentioned. She;s fine, but she;s not a game-breaking unit, although her free Soul Burn is pretty nice. Since she can;t deal any critical hits, her damage stats can go solely into her ATK. Bomb is a pretty interesting mechanic, but it does take a very specific team to set her up. When set up right, Summertime Iseria can really pop off, but if anything goes wrong, it can mean the death of your team.\nBuild Notes\nSummertime Iseria is built somewhat similar to Inferno Khawazu ; no reliance on Crit Rate% or Crit DMG% for her stats, instead SPD, ATK%, HP% and DEF%. The only difference is that she does need Effectiveness to work properly (vs Iwazu, who can use Eff% as a bonus stat). The stats you;d want to look for on Summertime Iseria is about:\n\n5,000+ ATK\n12,000 HP\n250 SPD\n1,200 DEF\n120%+ Effectiveness\n\nThe ATK stat may seem pretty high, but remember that her passive increases her ATK by 50% when fully skilled up.\nNote: Star of the Deep Sea is pretty much the only artifact to use on Summertime Iseria, and must be leveled up to +30 in order to function properly.\n",

Her S2 gives her self attack buff and boost all allies combat readiness, giving her team an edge in going first if she is built with speed.\nHer best skills are both her S3 and S1. S3 causes extinction and grants her stealth + attack buff for her allies (excluding herself). If she kills an enemy, the cooldown is reduced by 1 and she can cycle her skills quickly. She is great against revive units like Arby or Ruele. Her S1 ignores damage mitigation and can make quick work of units like ML Surin.

He also gains a barrier when doing this, giving him the much needed survivability, which is his biggest weakness. On top of that, he gains combat readiness when his fighting spirit is full, allowing him to get a turn much quicker.\nThe new update makes it such that his skill 3 can deal additional fixed damage without the enraged buff. While his S3 is available, he takes less critical damage. Despite that, he still needs some sustain or evasion to make him more tanky.\nHis play style may not suit many as it does reminds me of Dark Corvus with counter attack, but the slow arena battles will bore many people.\nStat wise, you want the following:\n\n3.5k+ Attack\n1k+ Def\n15k+ HP\n90%+ Crit Rate\nAny effect resistance is welcomed\n\nHe won;t need speed due to his counter attacks.

With her specialty change, her stats improve and she can get a decent chunk of hp on her.\nHer skill 3 is her best skill, granting barrier and be able to dispel buffs on the target. Her passive will work like aurius and can take some damage for any of your DPS units. The good thing about her is that she is a ML unit, so she won;t miss when it comes to trying to dispel buffs.\nOverall, she is a much better version and can be used in most PvE content that requires keeping the DPS alive. She has some use in PvP too, if needed, although she won;t be as effect as other top tier knights.\nA standard build would be:\n\n20k+ HP\n1.5k+ DEF\n120+ Speed (more is great)\n50%+ Effectiveness (to land dispel)\n\n",

She also excels in longer battles against other tanky teams.

He didn;t have his kit completely overhauled like some other Specialty Change units; however, he has completely improved in the areas he has shined in. Think of it like being able to do his job more efficiently, instead of being made efficient in another area.\nHowever, at the same time, this does mean that a few of his original problems are still here to stay. For instance, Glenn still isn;t able to hold his own against any particularly tanky fire units (which is especially bad, considering that Hwayoung is considered to be the meta unit as of this writing). He;s still a bit burdened by his 3-star stats, as well.\nDespite that, Glenn can still make as a pretty fun unit for people who need somebody to burst down any particularly pesky enemies, and don;t want to deal with any revivers on the enemy team. His multipliers are good enough to shoot down some weaker and average-health units, but for ultra-tanks he won;t do so well.\nBuild Notes\nThe Build Notes from Glenn;s pre-SC page can pretty much carry over to this page. You just have to build him with Speed, ATK%, Crit DMG%, and Crit Rate% for him to shine. Luckily, though, you need much less Crit Rate than before, due to his SC form being able to give himself a Crit Chance buff. This actually makes Glenn a little easier to build than before!\nYou;ll want your Glenn stats to look something like:\n\n3,500+ ATK\n250+ Speed\n50% Crit Rate\n270%+ Crit Damage (More is always better)\n\n",

      "description": "Vivian is a good character for longer fights as she is not a pure turn 1 nuker. Her S3 gives the whole team 3 turn immunity and attack buff while giving herself a greater attack buff. This indicates that she can only nuke efficiently after turn 1. This means that she is good in most PvE content, particularly shining in Banshee and Azimanak hunts due to her AoE attacks and potential S2 reset damage.\nIf you are lacking a Banshee Hunt AoE attacker, she can fill that role very well since her immunity will also prevent your team from damage over time effects from the Banshee and Azimanak.\nIn PvP Vivian serves as both a cleaver and a fantastic opener option with her high base speed of 115, granting the whole team attack up and immunity for three turns. Unfortunately with the presence of Basar she can quickly lose her set up options if he is left unchecked.\nWhen paired with Time Matter Vivian;s utility increases greatly, as each proc of her S2 is granted the damage increase and lowers her cooldowns. This allows Vivian to not only serve as a great PvE farmer but also an amazingly efficient cleaver with constant AoE barrages.\nHer S1 also has a rare 1.2 modifier, combined with her abnormally high base attack and her built in greater attack up buff, all of her damaging skills are guaranteed to sting even at low investment levels. Her self CR push on her S1 also allows her to cycle her cooldowns quicker or focus on single target damage instead of her AoE attacks.\n-Kuri\nNote: Recommended Exclusive Equipment would be 50% CR increase after using S3 for faster turn cycle.\n",

He can one shot many tough units as long as he has enough critical damage.\nThe only few people he has a hard time one-shotting are 15k+ health units that has Crimson Armin with Aurius. Use him against key DPS targets that can decimate your team. His basic attack can apply target debuff while his second skill can deal AoE damage and dispel 1 buff off each enemy on the opposing team.\nIf you can get really good gear, he can one shot any tank while having the attack buff. But it requires 3000+ attack, 100% crit rate and 240%+ crit damage.\nHe is pretty much a PvP only unit, but you can use him in regular story mode no problems.\nHe also has a niche use in Banshee 11 to 1 shot it with target debuff but it does require very high gear requirements.\n",

A few people have used Yoonryoung in a PvP area before, but she isn;t going to break any metas any time soon.\nThe main problem with Yoonryoung is that her stats are low  and she needs to attack four times in order for her Barrier to pop. While her s3 does have Attack increase for allies and Immunity, that;s about all it has; this, on top of a relatively high cooldown, is what causes her kit to flounder. It would take a lot of high quality gear for her to really work.\nBuild Notes\nThere;s a few builds that can work on Yoonryoung. One of which is, of course, the General Speed Build, which uses Speed/Immunity. Another, more experimental build is the Counter/Immunity build, which can be paired up with Elbris Ritual Sword. The Counter build is a bit more reliant on RNG, due to the nature of counterattacking, so a player who wants to go for a safer build should go for the Speed build.\nA good Yoonryoung looks to be about:\n\n15,000+ HP (More is better)\n1,500 Defense\n200+ Speed\n100%+ Effectiveness\n\n",

The only difference between her and Krau is that her skill 3 ignores shared damage and can heal herself. In a way, Krau is getting power crept via Yulha; however, they both have different spots in the meta.\nHer passive makes it such that enemies that attack her takes some reflected damage. Upon taking up to 70% damage, she self cleanses any debuffs on herself, pushes herself up a bit and gains a barrier. Her skill 1 can apply re-directed provoke.\nBuild Notes\nWhile she is pretty much designed with countering Hwayoung in mind, she doesn;t pose much of a threat if left alone in PvP situations. Unless she is on a counter set or Elbris, she won;t be doing much against single target attackers that ignore her.\nAs for the build:\n\n28k+ HP\n1.2k+ Defense\n180+ Speed\nAny effectiveness is good\n\nThis is the bare minimum to compete against any good Hwayoung and having 30k hp is better. She can also be used to bait other fire units or single target attackers as well. Running a counter set is a good idea against cleave teams as this will disrupt their combo in PvP.\n",

      "description": "Note: Zahhak;s equipment can now give him and an ally attack buff, which is good for longer battles.\n(Updated 10-27-22)\nNow that we;ve had a few weeks to test Zahhak out, the results are in ; he;s very high damage, and his gear requirements aren;t as high as other DPS units! His flagship skill comes from his S3, Execute, which increases his Hit Rate and Crit Rate by 50% and grants him Invincibility. The injuries part of his s3 isn;t as high priority, though. Zahhak boasts that both of his attacking skills grant him an extra 50% Crit Rate ; which lowers his need for Crit Rate in his stats ; along with high damage multipliers and an s3 that has a much lower chance to be Evaded!\nAs of this writing, Epic 7 is in a heavy Evasion meta; Violet particularly has been the bane of many players; existence. Although Zahhak isn;t guaranteed to hit Violet, he still has a much higher chance than most units would. On top of that, due to already having a base 50% Crit Rate built in, you only need about 50% Crit Rate on his actual stats, which leaves more room for other damage-dealing stats! Also, his S2 now provides him an extra turn and some CR push for another ally, allowing him to use S2 into S3 combo if needed.\nBuild Notes\nBuilding Zahhak is both easier and harder than building an average DPS unit. It;s easier because you only need to have 50% Crit Rate in his stats (similar to Lena), and his base stats when he;s 6-stars and fully awakened gives him a shockingly high 27% Crit Rate. However, because his Crit Rate necessities are so low, the goalposts for his other damage-dealing stats are much higher. The only build for him is Speed/Penetration, with CRIT DMG%/ATK%/SPD. If you don;t have any Penetration sets right now, you can use Crit Rate or Immunity until you get a Penetration set.\nThe ideal Zahhak stats looks to be about:\n\n4,100+ ATK (More is always better)\n900~ DEF\n8,800~ HP\n250~ Speed\n50% Crit Rate\n300% Crit Damage\n\n",

The only thing is that he is also pretty much a PvP character and most people don;t use him for PvE.\nHis third skill is a hard hitting AoE attack that can stun enemies. His basic attack can apply slow debuff but his second skill is just a plain AoE attack with no utility.\nZerato is much like Mercedes, but at least he can stun!\n",
